This study investigated the relationship between sibling bullying perpetration and victimization in early adolescence and high-risk behavior in early adulthood. Sibling bullying was assessed at 12 years in 6,988 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a birth cohort based in the UK and high-risk behavioral outcomes were assessed at 18-20 years. Frequent sibling bullying perpetration predicted antisocial behavior (OR=1.74; 95%CI, 1.38-2.20), while frequent sibling bullying victimization increased the odds of nicotine dependence (OR=2.87; 95%CI, 1.55-5.29), even after accounting for peer bullying and parent maltreatment. Categorical analysis revealed that particularly bullies and bully-victims were at risk of developing high-risk behavior. Finally, this study found that adolescents who were involved in bullying perpetration across multiple contexts (home and school) had the highest odds of reporting antisocial behavior (OR=3.05; 95%CI, 2.09-4.44), criminal involvement (OR=2.12; 95%CI, 1.23-3.66), and illicit drug use (OR=2.11; 95%CI, 1.44-3.08).

However, investigations in this area almost exclusively utilize decision-making focused paradigms. This emphasis makes it difficult to assess links between risk behaviors and raw risk reactivity independent of decision and feedback processes. A deeper understanding of this association has the potential to shed light on the role of risk reactivity in high-risk behavior susceptibility. To contribute toward this aim, this study utilizes a popular risk-taking game, the crocodile dentist, to assess links between individual differences in decision-free risk-reactivity and reported binge-drinking frequency levels. In this task, participants engage in a series of decision-free escalating risk responses. Risk-reactivity was assessed by measuring late positive potential responses toward risk-taking action initiation cues using high-density 256-Channel EEG. The results indicate that, after controlling for overall alcohol consumption frequency, higher rates of reported binge-drinking are associated with both increased general risk-taking responsivity and increased risk-reactivity escalation as a function of risk level.

Delivered in-person by a facilitator trained in MI, this four-session computer-assisted intervention provides personalized social network visualization feedback to help participants understand the people in their network who trigger their alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and those who support abstinence. If ready, participants are encouraged to make changes to their social network to help reduce their own high-risk behavior. Participants were 41 individuals (33 male, 7 female, 1 other; 23 African-American, 5 non-Latino White, 6 Latino, 7 other, mean age 48) who were transitioning from homelessness to permanent supportive housing. They were randomly assigned to either the MI-SNI condition or usual care. Readiness to change AOD use, AOD abstinence self-efficacy, and AOD use were assessed at baseline and shortly after the final intervention session for the MI-SNI arm and around 3-months after baseline for the control arm. Acceptability of the intervention was also evaluated. MI-SNI participants reported increased readiness to change AOD use compared to control participants. We also conducted a subsample analysis for participants at one housing program and found a significant intervention effect on readiness to change AOD use, AOD abstinence self-efficacy, and alcohol use compared to control participants. Participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable. We conclude that a brief computer-assisted Motivational Interviewing social network intervention has potential to efficaciously impact readiness to change AOD use, AOD abstinence self-efficacy, and AOD use among formerly homeless individuals transitioning to permanent supportive housing, and warrants future study in larger clinical trials.'",,,Tucker,Joan S,JS,,"RAND Corporation, United States.

Journal of Family Psychology, 26(4), 565-575, 2012; Johnston et al. 2016). Building on prior research, we tested a mediational model hypothesizing that Family Check-Up (FCU) intervention effects on young adult risk would be mediated by increases in self-regulation, and that these changes would continue to affect risk behavior as high school youths transitioned to young adulthood. We also predicted that the intent-to-treat intervention would be associated with lower levels of risk in young adulthood and that this effect would be accounted for by intervention-induced improvements in self-regulation during early adolescence, which in turn would prevent young adult risk. Participants were 593 adolescents and their families recruited from three public middle schools and randomized either to the FCU or to a control group. Item response theory was applied to construct a measure of high-risk behavior at this age, including risk behaviors such as substance abuse, high-risk sexual behavior, and vocational risk. Results suggested that changes in children's self-regulation that occurred early during the middle school years, and that were associated with the FCU, led to reductions in risk behaviors during young adulthood. This study builds on our prior research that has suggested that effects of the FCU during middle school lead to changes in a range of risk behaviors during the transition to high school (Fosco et al.

This transdisciplinary model suggests that, in any given individual, the number of genetic variants implicated in high-risk behavior and the way in which they are assorted and ultimately suppressed or activated in the brain by experiential and contextual factors help to explain behavioral orientations. Implications are that behavioral health problems can be amplified or reduced based on characteristics of an individual and socio-contextual influences on those characteristics. This emerging research has extraordinary implications for the design of prevention programs that more precisely target the malleable mechanisms that underlie behavioral health problems and, hence, more effectively prevent behavioral problems and promote resilience. A detailed, theory-driven examination of all evidence-based interventions is called for to identify the active ingredients that specifically impact these underlying mechanisms.

Methods This cross-sectional study was carried out with 430 female and male university in three higher education institutions located in the northern part of Iran in the year 2015. Samples were chosen through the stratified cluster random sampling method. They were requested to fill out the demographic data form and the Persian version of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey Questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis via the SPSS v.13 software. Findings Intentional injuries were more frequent in the male university students than female (p < 0.05). Also, 9.1% and 6.7% of the university students were physically injured or sexually assaulted by a boy/girl friend. No statistically significant difference was reported in dating violence between the male and female university students. The logistic regression test showed that the history of stealing money from parents without their permission, son's preferences in the family and gender are the most important predisposing factors for the university students' intentional injury.

We document, among Tanzanian agricultural plantation residents, migrant characteristics and test associations between migrant status and prevalent STI (HSV-2, syphilis, and HIV). From 623 plantation resident participants, we limit this analysis to participants about whom we know migration status (migrants n=242, non-migrants n=291). We collected behavioral data via audio-computer assisted self-interview survey, and clinical data via STI testing. We used multivariate Poisson regression models, stratified by gender and controlling for behavioral risk factors, to measure associations between migrant status and STI. In men, HIV prevalence was 9% for migrants, and 6% for non-migrants. HSV-2 prevalence was 57% for migrants, and 32% for non-migrants. Syphilis prevalence was 12% for migrants, and 3% for non-migrants. Among women, there were few differences in STI prevalence by migrant status: prevalence of HIV was 6% vs. 5% (migrants vs. non-migrants); HSV-2 prevalence was 68% vs. 65%; and syphilis prevalence was 11% vs. 8%. Being a male migrant was significantly associated with increased prevalence of any STI after controlling for sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics (APR=1.53, 95% CI 1.23-5.25). Migrant women did not have increased prevalence of STI as compared to non-migrant women (APR=1.03, 95% CI 0.85-1.24). Amongst Tanzanian agricultural workers, male migrants experienced elevated risk for prevalent STI as compared to male non-migrants. We suggest structural interventions to reduce risks associated with migration, especially in male migrants, including workplace-based STI prevention programs, and connecting migrants to resources and support within new communities. The key messages are: migrant men experience significantly elevated risk for prevalent STI, above and beyond sociodemographic and behavioral risk factors, as compared to their non-migrant peers; women in this Tanzanian agricultural plantation community overall had higher prevalence of some STIs than men, migrant women had similar STI risk as non-migrant women; and migration for work, an economic strategy for millions, also creates vulnerabilities, so workplace-based STI prevention programs and connecting migrants to community resources are essential.'",,,Ickovics,Jeannette R,JR,,"2 Department of Chronic Disease Epidemiology, Yale School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, USA.",eng,,"Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,England,Int J STD AIDS,9007917,0956-4624,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.1177/0956462416685486

It is currently unknown whether brief motivational interventions (BMIs) that provide feedback on DG participation can reduce this high risk behavior.

Mandated college students (Trial 1, N = 198, 46% female; Trial 2, N = 412; 32% female) were randomized to BMI or comparison control conditions. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to compare the BMI and comparison groups to determine whether the BMI reduced DG participation over time. Percent change talk (PCT) during the discussion of DG during the session was examined as a predictor of change in DG frequency, and gender was examined as a moderator of treatment effects. Controlling for regular drinking frequency, participants who received a BMI did not significantly reduce their DG frequency relative to the comparison group in either sample, and the BMI was equally ineffective at reducing DG behavior for men and women. DG-related PCT during the BMI was associated with lower DG frequency at the second follow-up in both trials. In Trial 1, PCT during the BMI was associated with less steep increases in DG frequency across the course of all follow-ups. Effects of PCT on DG behavior were not moderated by gender. Findings did not support hypothesized reductions in DG participation following a BMI. Future research should explore whether targeted DG-specific interventions could reduce DG participation and the role of in-session client language in facilitating such change.

We evaluated the attitudes, knowledge, and experiences of patients and providers related to overdose and naloxone rescue. Over a six month period, patients and providers within a large community hospital in Staten Island were recruited to complete tailored questionnaires for their respective groupings. 100 patients and 101 providers completed questionnaires between August, 2014 and January, 2015. Patient participants were primarily Caucasian males with a mean age of 37.7 years, of which 65% accurately identified naloxone for opioid overdose, but only 21% knew more specific clinical features. 68% of patients had previously witnessed a drug overdose. Notably, 58% of patients anticipated their behavior would change if provided access to an intranasal naloxone rescue kit, of which 83% predicted an increase in opioid use. Prior overdose was significantly correlated with anticipating no change in subsequent opioid use pattern (p=0.02). 99% of patients reported that their rapport with their health-care provider would be enhanced if offered an intranasal naloxone rescue kit. As for providers, 24% had completed naloxone rescue kit training, and 96% were able to properly identify its clinical application. 50% of providers felt naloxone access would decrease the likelihood of an overdose occurring, and 58% felt it would not contribute to high-risk behavior. Among providers, completion of naloxone training was correlated with increased awareness of where to access kits for patients (p<0.001). This study suggests that patients and providers have distinct beliefs and attitudes toward overdose prevention. Patient-Provider discussion of overdose prevention enhances patients' rapport with providers. However, access to an intranasal naloxone rescue kit may make some patients more vulnerable to high-risk behavior. Future research efforts examining provider and patient beliefs and practices are needed to help develop and implement effective hospital-based opioid overdose prevention strategies.""",,,Hansen,Helena,H,,"New York University Langone School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, NY, NY 10016, USA; Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research, Orangeburg, NY 10962, USA.",eng,,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,United States,J Subst Abuse Treat,8500909,0740-5472,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.1016/j.jsat.2016.07.005

The HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay detected seroconverting individuals one to three weeks earlier than a rapid HIV antibody test and up to two weeks earlier than a lab-based antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combo enzyme immunoassay (EIA). RT-LAMP was not as sensitive as a lab-based qualitative RNA assay, which could be attributed to the significantly smaller nucleic acid input volume.

However, the relationship of variants of these genes with spontaneous outcomes of HCV infection has not been fully investigated. To explore novel loci in the Chinese population, 34 tagging-SNPs in 9 candidate genes were genotyped for their associations with the outcomes of HCV infection. The distributions of different genotypes and haplotypes were compared among 773 HCV-negative controls, 246 subjects with HCV natural clearance, and 218 HCV persistent carriers recruited from hemodialysis patients and intravenous drug users. Our study implicated that TAP2, HLA-DOA, HLA-DOB, and tapasin loci were novel candidate regions for susceptibility to HCV infection and viral clearance in the Chinese population. Logistic regression analyses showed that TAP2 rs1800454 A (OR = 1.48, P = 0.002) and HLA-DOB rs2071469 G (OR = 1.23, P = 0.048) were significantly associated with increased susceptibility to establishment of HCV infection. However, high-risk behavior exposure and age were stronger predictors of HCV infection. Mutation of tapasin rs9277972 T (OR = 1.57, P =0.043) increased the risk of HCV chronicity, and HLA-DOA rs3128935 C (OR = 0.62, P = 0.019) increased the chance of viral resolution. With regards to the effect of rs3128925, interactions were found with high-risk behavior (P = 0.013) and age (P = 0.035).

High-risk behavior often occurs in an emotionally-charged context, and behavioral inhibition and emotion regulation play important roles in risk-related decision making. High impulsivity is an important potential contributor to high-risk behavior tendencies. We explored the relationships between high-risk behavior tendencies, impulsivity, and fMRI brain activations in an emotional Go/NoGo task. This task presented emotional distractor pictures (aversive vs. neutral) simultaneously with Go/NoGo stimuli (square vs. circle) that required a button press or withholding of the press, respectively. Participants' risk behavior tendencies were assessed with the Cognitive Appraisal of Risky Events (CARE) scale. The Barratt Impulsivity Scale 11 (BIS) was used to assess participant impulsivity. Individuals with higher CARE risk scores exhibited reduced activation related to response inhibition (NoGo-Go) in right orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These regions did not show a significant relationship with impulsivity scores. Conversely, more impulsive individuals showed reduced emotion-related activity (aversive-neutral distractors) in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, and right posterior OFC. There were distinct neural correlates of high-risk behavior tendency and impulsivity in terms of brain activity in the emotional Go/NoGo task. This dissociation supports the conception of high-risk behavior tendency as a distinct construct from that of impulsivity. Our results suggest that treatment for high-risk behavior may be more effective with a nuanced approach that does not conflate high impulsivity necessarily with high-risk behavior tendencies.""",,,Greenshaw,Andrew J,AJ,,"Department of Psychiatry, University of Alberta Edmonton, AB, Canada.",eng,,Journal Article,,,Switzerland,Front Syst Neurosci,101477946,1662-5137,,,,6,1,epublish,,PMC4354310

However, it is necessary to enhance these prevention methods and expand their coverage. In addition, the strengthening of antiretroviral therapy (ART) treatment for HIV-infected drug users is crucial for HIV/AIDS prevention and control.

Curing preferentially individuals who most often share injecting equipment has the advantage of preventing more infections. However, such high risk behavior IDUs are also more likely to become re-infected. We have created a model that can inform us about most efficient HCV treatment policy; the expected benefits per treatment of one HCV-infected IDU are calculated, defined as a decrease in the number of chronic HCV infections. This includes the probability that the cured IDU remains uninfected, and the number of new infections prevented both directly and indirectly in further infection generations. We explore analytically how these benefits depend on the syringe sharing frequency of the cured IDU. We find that whom to best cure is determined by the prevalence of HCV contamination among exchanged syringes within the IDU population. Treating lowest risk IDUs is most beneficial above a certain prevalence of contamination, since the term for re-infection dominates the equation in this domain. At lower prevalence treating highest risk IDUs is most beneficial, since here the term for prevention dominates. In a much simplified model the threshold between domains is found at exactly 50% HCV prevalence. The threshold value is lowered when taking HCV induced mortality or increased infectiousness during an acute stage of infection into account. It is increased when taking into account treatment duration, or when HCV-treatment is combined with intervention that reduces the syringe sharing rate of the cured IDU.'",,,Kretzschmar,M E E,ME,,"Julius Center, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Centre for Infectious Disease Control, RIVM, Bilthoven, The Netherlands.",eng,,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,United States,Math Biosci,0103146,0025-5564,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.1016/j.mbs.2014.09.006

This is often considered a risk factor for later drug abuse. In this scenario, the permanent effects of cocaine exposure during adolescence on anxiety levels and stress responsivity, which may result in behavioral phenotypes prone to addiction, are now starting to be unveiled. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the long-lasting effects of chronic cocaine administration during adolescence, on anxiety-like behavior and on stress response. Adolescent male Wistar rats were daily administered 45-mg cocaine/kg of body weight in three equal intraperitoneal doses with 1-h interval, from postnatal day (PND) 35 to 50. The effects of cocaine administration on anxiety levels, assessed in the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), and on social stress response, assessed in the resident-intruder paradigm (R/I), were evaluated 10 days after withdrawal, when rats were reaching the adulthood. The underlying dopaminergic activity, and the corticosterone and testosterone levels were determined. Our results showed that cocaine induced long-lasting alterations in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenals (HPA) axis function and in testosterone levels. Such alterations resulted in significant and enduring changes in behavioral responses to environmental challenges, such as the EPM and R/I, including the evaluation of potential threats that may lead to high-risk behavior and low-benefit choices. This was further supported by an altered dopaminergic function in the amygdala and hippocampus. The present findings provide new insights into how the use of cocaine during adolescent development may modulate emotional behavior later in life.

By 2008, the Army suicide rate had risen above the national average (20.2 per 100,000). In 2009, 160 active duty Soldiers took their lives, making suicide the third leading cause of death among the Army population. If accidental death, frequently the result of high-risk behavior, is included, then more Soldiers died by their own actions than in combat in 2009. The Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS) was thus created in 2009 to begin to address these problems. The Army STARRS project is a large consortium of seven different studies to develop data-driven methods for mitigating or preventing suicide behaviors and improving the overall mental health and behavioral functioning of Army Soldiers during and after their Army service. The first research articles from the Army STARRS project were published in late 2013 and early 2014. This work has already begun to outline important facets of risk in the military, and it is helping to drive an empirically derived approach to improvements in understanding mental disorders and risk behavior and to improve prevention and support of mental health and resilience. The Framingham Heart Study, started in the 1940s, marked a watershed event in utilizing large cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal collaborative research to identify and understand risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The Army STARRS project, through its collaborative, prospective, and robust innovative design and implementation, may provide the beginning of a similar scientific cohort in mental disorders. The work of this project will help understand biological and psychological aspects of military service, including those leading to suicide. When coupled with timely feedback to Army leadership, it permits near real-time steps to diagnose, mitigate, and manage emerging mental health issues and the root causes of risk and resilience in Army Soldiers, with potential impact extending across many traumatized populations-not unlike a parallel process that has markedly improved survival and recovery from physical combat wounds.'",,,Schoomaker,Eric B,EB,,,eng,,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,United States,Psychiatry,0376470,0033-2747,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.1521/psyc.2014.77.2.120

A total of 200 FSWs were randomly selected for the survey from February to September 2012. The age range of FSWs was 16-41 years (average age, 24.52  6.26 years), and the majority of these women (84.4%) were married. More than 88% of FSWs reported practicing unprotected sex because of clients' insistence. Further analysis showed a significantly higher rate of protected sex among unmarried FSWs (P < 0.01). Approximately 32% of FSWs did not undergo voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV, and this factor was significantly associated with the education level (P < 0.01), age (P < 0.01), and economic status (P < 0.05). Furthermore, 89.5% respondents did not ask their new clients about VCT/HIV status, and this factor was associated with the resident area (P < 0.05), age (P < 0.05), and economic status (P < 0.01) of FSWs. Authorities in this country should focus their HIV/AIDS prevention efforts on illiterate FSWs, married FSWs, and FSWs aged below 21 years or above 30 years.""",,,Kamarul,T,T,,Population Services and Training Center.,eng,,Journal Article,,,Japan,Jpn J Infect Dis,100893704,1344-6304,,,,6,0,ppublish,,DN/JST.JSTAGE/yoken/67.191

A cross sectional study was conducted at the National Blood Centre, Kuala Lumpur from 1st January 2009 to 31st June 2010. Data from 581,020 donors were analyzed from year 2004 to 2008. All data were retrieved from NBCKL Blood Bank Information System (BBIS). A total of 201 repeat donors were included in the study based on the inclusion criteria but only 132 repeat donors agreed to participate. Information on sociodemographic, risk factors, knowledge of donors and high risk behavior were extracted from standardize questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 14.0. The aim of this study was to determine the predictors of the seropositive infectivity among repeat blood donors at the NBCKL. The results showed Syphilis accounts for the highest and increasing seroconversion rate among other infections from 20.83% in year 2004 to 44.6% in year in year 2008.

Change agents themselves can be more important than the messages they convey. PCA selection is operationalized via heterogeneous methods based upon individual-level attributes. A sociometric position selection strategy, however, could increase peer influence potency and halt transmission at key network locations. In this study, we selected candidate PCAs based upon relative sociometric bridging and centrality scores and assessed their attributes in comparison to one another and to existing peer educators. We focused upon an emerging HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men in Southern India in 2011. PCAs selected based on their bridging score were more likely to be innovators when compared to other centrally-located PCAs, to PCAs located on the periphery, and to existing peer educators. We also found that sociodemographic attributes and risk behaviors were similar across all candidate PCAs, but risk behaviors of existing peer educators differed. Existing peer educators were more likely to engage in higher risk behavior such as receiving money for sex when compared to sociometrically selected peer changes agents. These existing peer educators were also more likely to exhibit leadership qualities within the overall network; they were, however, just as likely as other non-trained candidate peer change agents to report important HIV intravention behavior (encouraging condoms within their network). The importance of identifying bridges who may be able to diffuse innovation more effectively within high risk HIV networks is especially critical given recent efficacy data from novel HIV prevention interventions such as pre-exposure prophylaxis. Moreover, while existing peer educators were more likely to be leaders in our analysis, using peer educators with high risk behavior may have limited utility in enacting behavior change among sex worker peers or male clients in the network.'",,,Laumann,Edward O,EO,,"Department of Sociology, University of Chicago, Chicago, USA.",eng,,"Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,England,Soc Sci Med,8303205,0277-9536,,,,6,0,ppublish,,NIHMS562578

Therefore, we compared endorsers to non-endorsers, controlling for race, gender, and baseline outcomes, at two universities (Ns = 2007 and 2027). Neither sample yielded a majority (49% and 38% endorsement), but for both universities, all 17 outcome measures were significantly associated with endorsement across all types of analyses. Endorsers were less likely to drink, drank less, engaged in less high-risk behavior (e.g., heavy/binge drinking), and experienced fewer harms (e.g., physical injury), even when controlling for covariates. Racial/ethnic minority groups were more likely to endorse, compared to White students. By isolating a small window of time between high school and college that produces large changes in drinking behavior, and controlling for covariates, we can begin to hone in on factors that might explain relations among laws, risky behaviors, and harms.

An online survey was completed by 189 members and credentialees of the American Academy of HIV Medicine between April 2011 and September 2011. Ninety percent of respondents were familiar with the results of the iPrEx study, and most (78%) were familiar with CDC's interim guidance regarding the use of PrEP in MSM. Only 19% of respondents had prescribed PrEP. The majority of PrEP prescribers were compliant with CDC interim guidance; however, only 61% screened for hepatitis B. Of PrEP prescribers, 78% prescribed to MSM, 31% to MSW, and 28% to WSM. Greatest concerns about prescribing PrEP included development of antiretroviral resistance (32%), potential increase in high-risk behavior, (22%) and poor medication adherence (21%). Fifty-eight percent stated that HIV serodiscordance within a relationship most influenced their decision to prescribe PrEP to the HIV-seronegative partner. This study demonstrates that, despite awareness of the efficacy of PrEP, its use is limited. Survey participants used PrEP most commonly in MSM; however, a significant percentage also prescribed PrEP to women.

In this study we analyzed to what extent dual infections with different HIV-1 variants occur in a population group with high risk behaviour, high HIV-1 prevalence and in an area where multiple HIV-1 subtypes and Circulating Recombinant Forms (CRFs) co-circulate. We studied 69 MSM with our recently developed multi-region hybridization assay (MHA), based on fluorescent probe detection for eight common variants circulating in West and West Central Africa. At least 11 (15.9%) of the 69 patients were simultaneously infected with two different HIV-1 subtypes and/or CRFs. Among the 29 samples identified as subtype C by MHA in gag, 15 (57.7%) reacted with both C1 and C2 probes. Sequence analysis suggests that the majority of the samples reactive with C1 and C2 probes are most likely infected with two different subtype C clades. Single genome amplification and DNA dilutions confirmed dual infection with subtype D and C for MSM1193, triple infection with two different C subtype strains and one CRF02_AG strain in MSM1157 and showed that MSM3017 is at least co-infected with CRF06_cpx and CRF02_AG and another strain that could not be classified. Comparison of all subtype C sequences from the MSM population and from the general population from this and previous studies confirmed the intermixing of HIV-1 variants between low-risk women and high-risk men as shown by the intermixing of subtype C variants from MSM1157 and a female patient (02SN-HALD478). Comparison of dual infection rates between the general population and MSM in Senegal, show also clearly the importance of high HIV prevalence and high risk behavior in dual infections and subsequent intermixing of HIV-1 variants which can lead to emergence and spread of new recombinants (CRFs).'",,,Peeters,Martine,M,,"Laboratoire de Bactériologie-Virologie, Hôpital Le Dantec, Dakar, Senegal; UMI 233, TransVIHMI, Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD), University of Montpellier1 (UM1), Montpellier, France.",eng,,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,Netherlands,Infect Genet Evol,101084138,1567-1348,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.1016/j.meegid.2013.09.002

In recent years, several leaders in the AIDS and harm reduction fields have died ahead of their time. Some stopped taking their medications; others overdosed. Rather than weakness or pathology, French sociologist Emile Durkheim saw self-destructive behavior as a byproduct of social disorganization and isolation, as a way of contending with a breakdown of social bonds and alienation. There are any number of reasons why such behavior becomes part of work for those involved with battling the dueling epidemics of Hepatitis C, HIV, and related concerns. Forms of stress related to this work include secondary trauma, compassion fatigue, organizational conflict, burnout, complications of direct services, and lack of funding.

One way to address this is to encourage students to intervene when they see others engaged in high-risk behavior. This approach, referred to as bystander intervention, requires that individuals seek to influence others; however, research on bystander intervention has not explored how students communicate when they intervene. Drawing from a multiple goals perspective, we examined individuals' goals during intervention, the types of messages individuals use to intervene, and the relationship of design logic to sense of efficacy and messages used.

Here, we examined the distribution and expression of this protein by immunostaining with a commercially available polyclonal KCTD12 antibody in GISTs (n = 64) and other types of malignancy (n = 168) to clarify its diagnostic and clinical significance. Diffuse KCTD12 immunoreactivity was found in most GISTs (52 cases; 81%). KCTD12 expression was observed primarily in vascular endothelial cells, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and some neurons scattered throughout the cerebral cortex. KCTD12 was absent from not only the interstitial cells of Cajal but also interstitial cells of Cajal hyperplasia that was encountered incidentally in colon diverticulitis. KCTD12 immunostaining was also seen in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (2/10 cases; 20%), synovial sarcomas (2/10; 20%), solitary fibrous tumor (1/8; 13%), angiosarcoma (1/7; 14%), and colon adenocarcinoma (1/24; 4%). In survival analyses, the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate of patients without KCTD12 expression was only 16.7% compared with 95.6% in those with KCTD12 expression (P < .0001). Ki-67 and KCTD12 were significant predictors of recurrence-free survival, and KCTD12 expression provided additional information about recurrence-free survival after accounting for Ki-67 status. Overall, KCTD12 expression was specific for GISTs from neoplastic and nonneoplastic adult tissues other than brain and served as a predictor of GIST recurrence.

A survey was conducted among 19,123 Chinese college students recruited through stratified cluster sampling. About 9% of the students reported having had sex (male=13.3%, female=5.0%, OR=2.918), 3.6% had multiple sexual partners (male=5.7%, female=1.6%, OR=3.624), and 0.9% had commercialized sex (male=1.6%, female=0.3%, OR=6.169). Only 24.8% of sexually active students had used a condom for every sexual encounter, and there was no significant difference in condom use between male students and female students. Logistic regression showed that sex (female, OR=0.769), age (older, OR=1.263), exposure to pornographic information (higher, OR=1.751), drinking (intoxication, OR=1.437), and smoking (OR=2.123-5.112) were all determinants of sexual behaviors. Path analysis showed that exposure to pornographic information, level of consumption, and sex education were important social-environmental factors of condom use. Condom use was more common among those who had greater HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes toward high-risk behavior, self-efficacy, and intent to use a condom. Intentions were the most important and direct factor influencing condom use.

First, it was tested whether the relevant groups found in previous studies i.e., those with an early onset, a late onset, and no onset or low levels of risk behavior could be identified, while using a developmental model of a single, underlying construct of risk behavior. Second, departing from Moffitt's taxonomy of antisocial behavior, it was tested if early, but not late, onset risk behavior is predicted by a problematic risk profile in childhood. Data were used from TRAILS, a population based cohort study, starting at age 11 with two follow-ups at mean ages of 13.6 and 16.3 years. Latent transition analyses demonstrated that, both in early and middle adolescence, a single underlying construct of risk behavior, consisting of two classes (labeled as low and high risk behavior), adequately represented the data. Respondents could be clearly classified into four possible transition patterns from early to middle adolescence, with a transition from high to low being almost non-existent (2.5 %), low to low (39.4 %) and low to high (41.8 %) being the most prevalent, and high to high (16.2 %) substantial. As hypothesized, only the high-high group was characterized by a clear adverse predictor profile in late childhood, while the low-high group was not.

Such behaviors may include riding or driving without appropriate licensure or while under the influence of alcohol, as well as deciding not to use a safety device such as a helmet or safety belt. Given that these factors frequently occur in combination with one another, it is difficult to untangle the specific effects of individual factors leading up to the crash outcome. This study assesses how various rider-, driver-, and other crash-specific factors contribute to at-fault status in two-vehicle motorcycle crashes, as well as how these same factors affect the propensity for other high-risk behaviors. Furthermore, the interrelationships among fault status and these other behaviors are also examined using a multivariate probit model. This model is developed using police-reported crash data for the years 2006-2010 from the State of Ohio. The results show that younger motorcyclists are more likely to be at-fault in the event of a collision, as are riders who are under the influence of alcohol, riding without insurance, or not wearing a helmet. Similarly, motorcyclists were less likely to be at-fault when the other driver was of younger age or was driving under the influence of alcohol, without insurance, or not wearing their safety belt. Crash-involved parties who engaged in one high-risk behavior were more likely to engage in other such behaviors, as well, and this finding was consistent for both motorcyclists and drivers.

Minor complications including infection and bleeding occur frequently and, although rare, major complications have been reported. Healthcare professionals should be cognizant of the medical consequences of body piercing. Complications vary depending on the body-piercing site, materials used, experience of the practitioner, hygiene regimens, and aftercare by the recipient. Localized infections are common. Systemic infections such as viral hepatitis and toxic shock syndrome and distant infections such as endocarditis and brain abscesses have been reported. Other general complications include allergic contact dermatitis (e.g. from nickel or latex), bleeding, scarring and keloid formation, nerve damage, and interference with medical procedures such as intubation and blood/organ donation. Site-specific complications have been reported. Oral piercings may lead to difficulty speaking and eating, excessive salivation, and dental problems. Oral and nasal piercings may be aspirated or become embedded, requiring surgical removal. Piercing tracts in the ear, nipple, and navel are prone to tearing. Galactorrhea may be caused by stimulation from a nipple piercing. Genital piercings may lead to infertility secondary to infection, and obstruction of the urethra secondary to scar formation. In men, priapism and fistula formation may occur. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and have a piercing or are considering obtaining one need to be aware of the rare complications that may affect them or their child. Though not a 'complication' per se, many studies have reported body piercing as a marker for high-risk behavior, psychopathologic symptoms, and anti-social personality traits. When it comes to piercing complications, prevention is the key. Body piercers should take a complete medical and social history to identify conditions that may predispose an individual to complications, and candidates should choose a qualified practitioner to perform their piercing. As body piercing continues to be popular, understanding the risks of the procedures as well as the medical and psychosocial implications of wearing piercing jewelry is important for the medical practitioner.""",,,Laumann,Anne,A,,"Department of Dermatology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.",eng,,Review,,,New Zealand,Am J Clin Dermatol,100895290,1175-0561,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.2165/11593220-000000000-00000

Women were categorized based on levels of adherence and risky behaviors, and we sought to determine if these classifications were associated with clinical outcomes of HIV viral load and CD4 counts. High levels of adherence were correlated with low risk behaviors (abstinence, consistent use of condoms, etc.).

For boys, shyness reduces relationships between advanced maturity and risk behavior, whereas not being shy exacerbates the relationships between advanced maturity and high-risk behavior. Controlling for romantic involvement and peer victimization did not alter the moderating effects, thus failing to support the idea that the weaker links for shy youths were due to shy youths not being drawn into advanced peer groups by romantic partners or peers.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of children (ages 5-17, N=331) and accompanying caretakers in peri-urban Lusaka, Zambia, using both closed- and open-ended questions to investigate HIV knowledge and communication. We found that while 67% of children had heard of HIV, only 26% and 23% could accurately name a major mode of transmission and prevention, respectively. In a multivariate model, increasing age was the only significant demographic correlate of a child's ability to offer accurate responses to either question.

Importantly, this effect is observed independently in nonsmokers and smokers, although the circuit strength distinguishes smokers from nonsmokers, predicts addiction severity in smokers, and is not secondary to smoking per se, thus representing a trait-like circuitry biomarker.

Study participants were voluntary individuals 18 years of age or older recruited from AIDS Center VCT unit in Tbilisi, Georgia. Eligibility criteria of participants were: HIV positive result confirmed by western blot; age; and voluntary participation. Total 175 patients undergo interview with specially designed questionnaires. Most of the participants were male (71.4%), age range of HIV positives varied from 20 to 77 years old. Prevalence of HCV among HIV positive patients is high. Almost half (48.57%) HIV positive patients are co-infected with HCV. Men were more likely than women co-infected with HCV (60.80% and 18% accordingly). Major risk factor of male co-infection was related to drug use, needle and injection equipment sharing. Prevalence of HCV among injecting drug users was (73.40%). Drug users had 3.25 times more risk (PR 3.25; 95%CI; CL--1.89-5.26; p<0.01) to be infected with HCV compare non IDUs. Prevalence of being infected with HBV (Anti-HBc) among HIV positives was 43.42% (76/175) and the prevalence of Chronic HBV (HBsAg positive) was 6.86% (12/175).

Rates are currently low compared to the rest of the South Asian region, and the disease is relatively confined to small, high-risk populations--mainly injection drug users (IDUs) and commercial sex workers. Yet if steps are not taken quickly to keep the epidemic in check, it could easily spread to the general population as it has in other countries nearby. This would both increase the negative impact of HIV/AIDS and make it much harder to target for containment. It is therefore imperative that healthy behavior be promoted among IDUs and sex users, not only for their own health, but for the health of the country. Prevention will be the key to halting the spread of HIV infection through the implementation of communication and education programs aimed to change high-risk behavior. However, the disparate number of HIV/AIDS prevention programs independently operating in Bangladesh combined with the difficulty in adequately targeting this unique population of IDUs and sex workers establishes a complex situation where attaining behavior change is extremely difficult.

The ADD or ADHD group had a significantly greater incidence of mental health and school behavior problems than other children with burn injuries. They also had a significantly greater history of high risk behavior at the time of injury than the comparison group. Children with ADD or ADHD who also had an additional mental health diagnosis had a higher incidence of school behavior problems. Our findings suggest the need for additional studies of children with ADD or ADHD who sustain burn injuries. Children with ADD or ADHD who have school behavior problems and/or a tendency to engage in high-risk behavior may be at greatest risk for burn injuries and most likely to benefit from educational counseling or other modalities of burn prevention.'",,,Kagan,Richard J,RJ,,"College of Social Work, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.",eng,,Journal Article,,,England,J Burn Care Res,101262774,1559-047X,,,,9,0,ppublish,,10.1097/BCR.0b013e31818480e1

It identified 18-50% of those who presented with violence-related injuries and who continued to engage in high-risk behavior at the 1-month follow-up. These results indicate that the SAGE survey scores based on the responses to all 12 questions is not effective in identifying those youths at risk for general violent behavior, especially with a high-risk population. A set of four questions from the 12-question SAGE survey, however, was successful at tracking specific types of at-risk behaviors.

Immunocompromised states like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), systemic neoplasia and organ transplantation have enhanced the frequency of fungal infections. High-risk behavior, IV drug abuse and air travel have led to the emergence of new fungal infections hitherto geographically localized. The pathology in the central nervous system (CNS) is dictated largely by the size of the fungus - the yeast forms, by virtue of their small size enter the microcirculation to cause meningitis and microabscesses, while hyphal forms invade the vasculature to manifest as large pale or hemorrhagic infarcts. The growth kinetics of fungi, the antigenic character of the capsule. the proteases secreted by the mycelial forms and the biochemical milieu in the host also determine clinical manifestations. A hospital-based analysis of the available information from India suggests that in the non-HIV patient population, hyphal forms like Aspergillosis and Zygomycosis are the most common pathogens, while yeast forms like Cryptococcus and Candida are the prime pathogens in cases of HIV/AIDS, the altered macrophage function acting in synergy with suppressed cell-mediated immunity. In Northeastern states, systemic infection by Penicillium marneffei is reported in association with HIV though CNS involvement is not recorded. Although fungal infections of the CNS are reported from various hospitals in India, studies are limited by non-availability of relevant microbiological studies and the reported prevalence data is biased by the surgical practices, availability of postmortem and microbiology and laboratory support.

All students said that unprotected sex with an HIV-positive man or woman can transmit the HIV virus to a negative man or woman but at the same time 43.6% of students believed that there is a preventive vaccine for HIV and 39.8% understood that HIV can be cured if it is diagnosed early. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that the students who had more knowledge on HIV and AIDS were: older boys, fathers having more income, business or service as father's occupation, having more mass media exposure, being senior students, living in a university dormitory, and being students of faculty of arts, social sciences, and science.

It is reported that about 3,800 new cases of oral cancer are diagnosed in Hungary each year with approximately 1,700 associated deaths. Oral cancer is the 6th most common cancer in men. Most oral cancers are preventable; 75% of oral cancers are related to tobacco use, alcohol use, or use of both substances together. While there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of visual examination as a method of screening for oral cancer in the general population, screening in high-risk populations is highly recommended. It was presumed that high-risk behavior including tobacco and alcohol use is one of the characteristics of Roma people. The main aim of the study was to elaborate a screening model program for the Roma population to determine risk factors of oral cancer and establish early diagnosis hence to reduce morbidity and mortality. In the program we planned to survey the risk factors in the target population, establish the diagnosis of oral cancer and/or pre-cancer and direct the patients to health care facilities. First we determined the target population in four Hungarian towns with the help of Roma social workers and local public health officers. We assembled a questionnaire on risk factors. Training for Roma social workers and screening personnel was also accomplished. Screening for oral precancerous lesions and cancer and survey the risk factors in the target population were performed at the same time. Patients screened to be positive were referred to specialists. Altogether 1,146 persons, 656 male and 490 female (age 20-77 years, mean 40 years), participated in the screening; 84% of them reported on some kind of complaints. We have got valid data on risk factors in connection with oral cancer. More than fifty percent of participants did not clean their teeth regularly, 75% were smokers, while 45% drunk alcohol regularly. 1,6% of screened participants had oral lesions that did not require referral to a specialist, while 2.3% of the screened subjects had referable oral mucosal lesions including leukoplakia. The overwhelming majority (93%) of participants screened to be positive did not see dentist regularly. As a conclusion, we elaborated a screening model program, which is applicable for disadvantaged (e.g. Roma) population to determine risk factors of oral cancer and establish early diagnosis hence to reduce morbidity and mortality. We surveyed the risk factors in the target population, established the diagnosis of oral cancer and/or pre-cancer lesions and directed the patients to care facilities. We also assisted them to get appropriate long-term care and follow-up.

Results indicated that risk perceptions of IDUs and controls were highly correlated on many items; however, IDUs perceived several items, such as hepatitis, HIV, handguns, and unprotected sex, as markedly more risky. IDUs also perceived both themselves and others as having greater risk of contracting hepatitis and HIV. IDUs wanted significantly reduced regulation of drugs, including prescription drugs, heroin, valium, and barbiturates. Factor analyses conducted to understand how risk ratings related to various characteristics that have been shown to influence risk perception revealed 3 factors that account for approximately 80% of the variability in risk perception across groups: Factor 1, related to the severity of the risk; Factor 2, related to the certainty of the risk; and Factor 3, related to the immediacy of the risk. However, IDUs more strongly associated the extent to which they were personally affected by a risk item and the extent to which the risk affected fewer or more people to Factor 1, whereas control participants more strongly associated these characteristics with Factor 2.

In the present study, adolescent animals were exposed to twenty days of either saline (0.9% sodium chloride), cocaine (20 mg/kg) or ethanol (1 g/kg) i.p. followed by a fifteen-day washout period. All animals were tested as adults on several behavioral measures including locomotor activity induced by a novel environment, time spent in the center of an open field, novelty preference and novel object exploration. Animals exposed to cocaine during adolescence and tested as adults exhibited a greater locomotor response in a novel environment, spent less time in the center of the novel open field and spent less time with a novel object, results that are indicative of a stress or anxiogenic response to novelty or a novel situation. Adolescent animals chronically administered ethanol and tested as adults, unlike cocaine-exposed were not different from controls in a novel environment, indicated by locomotor activity or time spent with a novel object. However, ethanol-exposed animals approached the novel object more, suggesting that exposure to ethanol during development may result in less-inhibited behaviors during adulthood. The differences in adult behavioral responses after drug exposure during adolescence are likely due to differences in the mechanisms of action of the drugs and subsequent reward and/or stress responsivity.

Despite the availability of hepatitis B vaccine, the overall prevalence of hepatitis B virus infection has declined little in recent years. Hepatitis B virus causes liver injury by an immune response against the virus-infected liver cells and is not directly cytopathic, although immunosuppression appears to enhance replication and lead to direct cytotoxicity. The interplay of the host immune response and the virus's ability to replicate is a prime determinant of the likelihood of liver injury, its intensity, and progression to cirrhosis. A series of stages evolve in the life cycle of each patient's infection, with associated decreases in viral load at each successive stage. Viral mutations in the polymerase or the core gene affect replication and may enhance liver injury. Recently, genotypes have been identified that are linked to clinical outcomes, drug responses, and mutations. Four drugs (interferon alpha, lamivudine, adefovir, and entecavir) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of hepatitis B virus; they effectively decrease replication and reduce inflammation and fibrosis. Treatment of hepatitis B virus in complex situations such as co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus or immunosuppressive therapy remains challenging. The use of hepatitis B vaccine has been shown to reduce the incidence of new infection in many regions.

In the present study, adolescent and adult animals were first tested on several behavioral measures (novel environment exploratory behavior, novel object preference, novelty-induced impulsivity and novelty-induced exploration) which were used to categorize them as high- (HR) or low-responders (LR). The purpose of the present study was to characterize the neurochemical responsivity of the nucleus accumbens septi (NAcc) in HR and LR adolescent and adult animals in response to a systemic challenge of cocaine. Regardless of age, animals that were more reactive when placed in a novel environment had greater cocaine-induced increases in dopamine (DA). Several important and complex neurochemical differences existed between adolescent and adult animals. Adolescent animals that rapidly approached the novel object (i.e., HR) were the only group to show greater cocaine-induced responsivity. However, adult animals that spent less time near the novel object (i.e., LR) were the only group to have greater cocaine-induced responsivity. Adolescent animals that approached a novel object faster (HR) showed an increased dopaminergic (DAergic) response to an acute cocaine challenge. In contrast, adolescent animals that spent less time with the novel object had an increased cocaine-induced DAergic response compared to HR adults. Adults that approached the object less had a greater cocaine-induced DA response relative to HR adults. Finally, cocaine yielded a greater DA response in adolescent animals that showed a high novelty-induced exploration and impulsivity response, whereas the opposite was true for adults. The differences in response to cocaine between ages and groups are likely due to ontogenetic differences in brain regions that are involved in reward and/or stress responsivity.'",,,Kirstein,Cheryl L,CL,,"Department of Psychology, University of South Florida, 4202 E.

Since the onset of the AIDS epidemic, oral sex has been increasingly used both by heterosexual and homosexual partners. Even if the risk of HIV transmission with oral sex is very low, oral sex is a major mode of transmission for syphilis, gonorrhea, and genital herpes. Condoms are seldom used for oral sex. The transmission of STI by oral sex is less documented in heterosexual than in homosexual patients. The level of knowledge does not seem to reduce risky behavior in the most concerned population. An infection not normally considered as sexually transmitted (i.e. hepatitis C) may be transmitted by high risk sexual behavior increasing the risk of blood-blood contact, as recently reported among HIV-infected homosexual men. The emergence of high-risk sexual practices (traumatic practices, fisting) in a specific population required focused prevention measures to avoid blood-transmitted infections. The increased risk of HIV transmission by ST co-infection (syphilis, genital herpes, gonorrhea) and the potential morbidity of STI in HIV infected patients should also be emphasized.'",,,Bouscarat,F,F,,"Service de Dermatologie et Dispensaire Antivénérien, Hôpital Bichat, Assistance-publique-Hôpitaux-de-Paris, 46 rue Henri-Huchart, 75018 Paris, France. fabrice.bouscarat@wanadoo.fr",fre,,Review,,,France,Med Mal Infect,0311416,0399-077X,,,,9,0,ppublish,,10.1016/j.medmal.2005.03.003

Relevant behaviors for each subject were established at baseline interviews, following which both groups were polygraphed at 3 months. All subjects were polygraphed again at 6 months. The hypothesis was that subjects in the ""Polygraph Aware"" group would have engaged in fewer high-risk behaviors, based on their self-report during the examination. Thirty-two subjects (64%) attended the first polygraph examination, with 31 (97%) disclosing an average of 2.45 high-risk behaviors each previously unknown to supervising probation officers.

Disclosures to treatment providers and probation officers also increased. It was concluded that polygraph testing resulted in offenders engaging in less high-risk behavior, although the possibility that offenders fabricated reports of high-risk behaviours to satisfy examiners is also considered; similarly, offenders seemed to be more honest with their supervisors, but this only occurred after experience of the test itself.

When searching for such clues, it is important to exclude individuals with genetically determined absence of receptors, as this protective mechanism could not be induced by HIV specific vaccines. Homozygosity for the DeltaC32 mutation of CCR5 prevents R5 HIV infection, independent of any virus-specific immune responses that may be acquired by exposure, while heterozygosity influences susceptibility to low level exposure. Reports on the in vitro susceptibility of EU cells compared to controls have been conflicting. Therefore, we studied 14 EUs with homozygous wild type CCR5, using a newly developed in vitro challenge assay (IVCA) to measure the magnitude and breadth of resistance to infection among EUs. CD8+ cells were relatively increased compared to controls, and were largely responsible for resistance to challenge, which depended on dose of virus inoculum, and extended across clades.

A total of 2,217 first- and fourth-year students determined by stratified sampling constituted the study group. All students who volunteered to participate completed a questionnaire assessing sociodemographic and knowledge factors, sexual attitudes, behavior, and history of STDs. The rate of students having had sexual experience was 36.6%. Males were more sexually active than females. Most students (71.4%) began sexual activity at ages 15-19 without any difference by gender. Males reported significantly more sexual partners than females. Similarly, the rate of male students never using condoms was significantly higher than females. Condom was the most frequent contraception method, followed by oral contraceptives and withdrawal. Mean score on the knowledge questions was 16.29 (highest score 30). The most widely known STD was HIV infection and AIDS. Students' knowledge of transmission routes, signs and symptoms, and risk groups of STDs was insufficient. Main sources of knowledge were visual and print media, and friends. Most students (84.7%) viewed prevention from STDs as a person's own responsibility. Young people in Turkey are sexually active and tend to engage in high-risk behavior. However, their knowledge on sexual health and sexually transmitted diseases is insufficient.

People who have many sex partners and do not use condoms, and people who inject drugs and share unsterilized injecting equipment have the greatest risk of contracting HIV and infecting others.  How quickly and extensively an HIV/AIDS epidemic spreads in a given population depends largely upon the extent to which people with many sex partners mix with people with fewer partners.  A World Bank research report has, however, found that people who engage in high-risk behavior act to reduce their risk of contracting and spreading HIV when they have the knowledge and means to do so and a supportive community.  The report highlights the following strategies to reduce risky behavior: providing information, lowering the costs of safer behavior, and raising the costs of risky behavior.  Governments' main responsibilities in preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS are reducing the negative externalities of high-risk behavior and producing public goods.  Without government action, individuals and firms will not have the incentives to do what is necessary.

The model calculated long-term HIV prevalence, number of AIDS cases, and total population size for two scenarios: vaccination program versus no vaccination program.

Evidence.',,,"b""The literature review herein reveals substantial information regarding the safety, efficacy, short-term complications, long-term complications, and noncontraceptive benefits of sterilization. This information should be helpful for providers and potential sterilization candidates. The review also reveals areas where the data are unclear. Points to keep in mind during counseling include the following: The vast majority of women are satisfied with the decision to undergo sterilization. The fact that regret occurs underscores the importance of counseling and adequate individual deliberation before the procedure. In addition to the difficulty and expense associated with sterilization reversal, the woman should thoroughly understand the permanence of the procedure. Although failure is a rare event, it can occur many years after the procedure. Although evidence suggests that hysterectomy rates are higher in sterilized women aged less than 30 to 35 years, it is unlikely that there is a plausible biologic effect of sterilization on hysterectomy risk. An association between tubal sterilization and menstrual cycle changes does not seem valid for changes noted up to 2 years after the procedure. Data are unclear and inconsistent among studies observing women more than 2 years after the procedure. Evidence consistently shows that sterilization is associated with a reduced incidence of ovarian cancer and pelvic inflammatory diseases. Most studies show no effect or improvement of sexual satisfaction after sterilization. Complications during and postprocedure are rare. Sterilization provides no protection against the acquisition of sexually transmitted disease. Patients and their physicians should recognize that sterilized women may need more targeted preventive efforts for health screening and to reduce high-risk behavior than women who use other contraceptive methods. The surgeon's experience and the woman's preferences should govern the ultimate decision regarding the approach and occlusion method. Level II-2 evidence indicates comparable safety between interval laparoscopy and minilaparotomy. Data consistently show that in experienced trained hands, tubal sterilization is safe and highly effective regardless of the approach or occlusive method. Attention to the subtleties of technique seems to be most important in ensuring procedure safety and efficacy. Reanalysis of the CREST data shows that the cumulative failure rate of bipolar coagulation is comparable with the failure rate of unipolar coagulation if a substantial length of tube is adequately coagulated. The data discussed herein can be used to guide management decisions that may increase accessibility and reduce cost of the procedure. Low-resource settings and office settings have maintained an excellent safety record for this procedure through performance of sterilization under local anesthesia. The use of local anesthesia enables a change in procedure location from an inpatient operating room to a free-standing surgical clinic or adequately equipped office. Local anesthesia, with or without preoperative medication, is an excellent option associated with a lower complication risk, reduced cost, and shorter, easier recovery. The surgeon should have specific training in the effective use of local anesthetics, preoperative medications, and management of rare complications in low-resource settings. Little additional research is needed regarding the safety and efficacy of standard sterilization approaches and occlusion methods. There is a need for continued development of nonsurgical methods of sterilization, microlaparoscopic approaches performed in the office setting, and the feasibility and acceptance of service provision by nonspecialist health care providers. The evidence indicates that female sterilization can be performed safely in a variety of resource settings ranging from rural sterilization camps in developing countries to high-tech, resource-rich operating rooms in developed c""",,,Cullins,V,V,,"AVSC International, New York, New York, USA.",eng,,Review,,,United States,Obstet Gynecol Clin North Am,8709551,0889-8545,,,,11,0,ppublish,,S0889-8545(05)70175-3

These women often use condoms for the single-time contact. However, since the HIV/AIDS epidemic, casual partners have decreased in number. These days, most of their sexual contacts occur within long-term partnerships, and within these relationships, condom use is rare. Although the message that condoms should be used during high-risk behavior has been largely accepted, the definition of a high-risk relationship needs to be extended from casual partnerships to include multiple long-term partnerships.

The article consists in a report of a retrospective study of the effects of such enforced isolation in the HIV-positive subgroup committed under the Act within an eight-year period. Relevant information was obtained from the records of medical and psychiatric hospitals, the social services and correctional care authorities. Modification of high-risk behaviour was assessed by enquiries involving attending physicians, the social services, and prison and police authorities, and by interviews with the patients. During the 8-year period, 1.5 per cent (44/2982) of registered HIV-positive patients in Stockholm County were committed by the county administrative court to compulsory admission. Of the 44 patients, 25 (57%) were born in Sweden, and 19 (43%) elsewhere (mostly sub-Saharan African countries where HIV is highly endemic).

We studied students, most of the age group thought to be most at risk, investigating sexual behavior, knowledge and attitudes to AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The level of knowledge about the problems of AIDS and STDs was similar for both sexes and for all ages and levels of education of the students. Students had a reasonable knowledge of AIDS, particularly concerning the transmission of HIV (88.6% of students aware), risk behavior (80.8%), AIDS treatment (57.0%) and more general information about HIV (49.4%). They were poorly informed about the transmission (42.9%) and complications (0.69%) of other STDs. Most students had positive attitudes towards HIV issues, particularly the use of preventive measures (3.41 in 5) and the acceptance of infected individuals (3.98 in 5). However, few had seriously considered that AIDS and STDs might impact on their own sex lives (1. 84 in 5) and some were even fatalistic concerning HIV infection. The students were highly sexually active, having intercourse a mean of 31 times per year. Their sexual behavior depended on age and sex. The 15- to 19-year-olds preferred occasional partners. They had sexual intercourse 1 to 3 times per month and used condoms 10 to 20% of the time. The 20- to 29-year-olds had multiple partners. They had sexual intercourse 3 to 5 times per month and used condoms more than 30% of the time. Students over the age of 30 had many partners in addition to their regular partner.

Significantly more women than men had high-risk sexual behavior (40. 5% of men claimed to regularly use condoms, versus only 22.7% of the women and 11.9% of the women accepted anal penetration versus only 8. 4% of men). The general assumption is that students, who have a high level of education, should be well informed concerning AIDS and STDs and should therefore have positive attitudes and responsible sexual behavior. This study demonstrates that the assumption bears no resemblance to reality. The students were aware of the way in which HIV is transmitted and of what construes risky behavior, but there was nonetheless a high frequency of high-risk behavior (e.g. multiple sexual partners, anal and oral sex, homosexuality, intravenous drug use). The behavior of the students was not significantly different from that of young people living on the streets of Lom. There were significant relationships between knowledge and attitudes and between some types of sexual behavior and knowledge. However, there was no correlation between attitudes and behavior.

Respondents' comfort in asking a partner about his/her sexual history was positively associated with their level of self-esteem, and negatively related to peer pressure in this population. As in previous studies of college populations, HIV knowledge per se does not confer a protective effect against high-risk behavior. However, knowledge was found to be an enabling factor with regard to students' comfort levels in asking about their partner's sexual histories, and in requesting that partners take an AIDS test.""",,,Josephson,V,V,,"College of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, USA.",eng,,"Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,Netherlands,J Community Health,7600747,0094-5145,,,,0,0,ppublish,,10036646

The focus of clinical research needs to be tailored to the clinically relevant situations for each drug of abuse. In general, the pharmacotherapies being considered for treatment of abuse and dependence disorders are used to achieve one or more of six major objectives: 1. Reduction in the risk of addiction; 2.

For all outcomes, both the validity and the meaningfulness must be established. Although considerable neurobiological knowledge relative to cocaine has been acquired, investigation of applicable medications based on these data is still under development. Many studies to date have focused on modifying dopamine function. Because dopamine plays a critical biologic role in motivation, reward and locomotion, modification of its activity may potentially contribute to serious adverse effects. An optional strategy might require the use of several medications that have different mechanisms of action, or several medications targeted at different aspects of the problem (e.g., relapse craving, etc.). The agonist approach is believed to be potentially problematic because of effects on cardiovascular function and temperature regulation. A substitution model (comparable to methadone for heroin dependence) has not been proposed. The antagonist model is hampered by the fact that reinforcing effects are mediated through dopamine, which, if blocked, might produce a sufficient anhedonic state that compliance with the treatment regimen might be unlikely.

Of the 368 men who were seronegative at enrollment, 241 were re-evaluated after 12 months of follow-up.  There were 9 seroconversions (3.6/100 person years).  Sexual contact with a prostitute in the preceding year was reported by 33% of truckers and only a third of these encounters involved condom use.  Ever-use of condoms was reported by only 51%.

The survey of 664 college students, who responded via beach side computers hooked up to the Internet, showed that 36% of spring breakers hadn\'t had any sexual encounters during their week at the beach vs. 23% who said they had no such encounters during a typical week at school.  23% said they had one encounter per week during spring break, while 18% had two or three liaisons, 9% had four or five, and 13% had more than five.  A closer look at those who had more than five partners per week reveals even more startling figures: 47% said they did not use a condom during any of their encounters during spring break vs. 23% for all spring breakers and 15% for those who were with only one partner.

IVDUs who entered treatment had higher symptom levels than those who did not enter treatment. Higher symptom levels were found among injectors than noninjectors, and needle sharers had especially high psychiatric symptom levels. Higher symptom levels were found among those who seroconverted in the 6 months following notification, but not thereafter. Symptom levels did not distinguish between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals 24 months following notification of seropositivity. Taken together, these findings indicate that elevated psychiatric symptoms are risk factors for continued high risk behavior, as well as for seroconversion. The data add to those of Brooner and colleagues (1993), who demonstrated that ASPD serves as a risk factor for HIV infection. The fact that antisocial personality disorder and psychiatric severity are associated with risky behavior and with actual HIV infection further expands earlier findings showing that these two factors are associated with poorer treatment outcome. Other axis II disorders (e.g., borderline or narcissistic), as well as other axis I disorders with high symptom levels that were not well represented in these studies (schizophrenia, manic depressive illness), may also show similar elevated rates of risky behavior and seroconversion, although there is a scarcity of data currently available to assess the risk behavior of these patients. The evidence from treatment studies that psychiatrically focused therapies, when combined with substance abuse treatment, can improve overall outcome for patients with clinically significant levels of psychiatric symptoms may be relevant in the design of future risk reduction efforts. That is, these treatment outcome studies may serve as a starting point for exploring the feasibility and efficacy of using psychiatrically focused treatment to reduce risky behavior and HIV infection among psychiatrically symptomatic IDUs.'",,,O'Brien,C P,CP,,"Philadelphia VA Medical Center, USA.",eng,,"Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,United States,NIDA Res Monogr,8811762,1046-9516,,,,0,0,ppublish,,9154270

Women are viewed as more susceptible to HIV infections due to their social status and other characteristics.  The physical attributes that increase transmission to women are the open genital configuration and the higher density of HIV infection in men's semen.  Women are also more likely to be recipients of blood transfusions because of hemorrhage and anemia during pregnancy and childbirth.  Increases in transmission in China are due to prostitution.  The lack of symptoms among HIV carriers means sex partners do not know.  Prostitutes are not aware generally about their male partners' high risk behavior, such as drug use or HIV infection.  Illiteracy is a major reason for lack of information about HIV infections among prostitutes.  Women may request condom use, but men may refuse.  Premarital sex and having multiple partners increases the risk of transmission.  The only effective measure for preventing the spread of AIDS is a health education campaign and improved education.  The World Health Organization (WHO) is engaged in a global effort to improve women's status in their social, economic, and political lives.  WHO declared a readiness to work with women's groups in preventing AIDS and to provide information to groups and individuals about the danger of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.  A study in 1993 revealed that only 34.8% of prostitutes in Beijing, Dalian, Nanjing, and Xian were aware that condoms could protect against HIV infections.  45% never used condoms.  71.1% viewed condoms as useful contraceptives and only secondarily as protection against sexually transmitted diseases or AIDS.  Almost 39% of prostitutes' partners agreed to use condoms.  8% agreed only with a decrease in the price of services.  48.2% refused.  68% believed themselves to be at little risk of contracting HIV.  WHO estimated that 1 million women became infected with HIV in 1993.  Almost 50% of new adult HIV carriers are women.  By the year 2000, 13 million women will be HIV infected, and about 4 million women will have died of AIDS.  18.5 million people are currently infected worldwide, and 4.5 million people have AIDS.

In well designed studies of patients with gynecologic cancers, demographic stratification usually is performed based on race/ethnicity, age, or geographic locale, but not on economic class. The unstated assumption of many of these reports is that women of color, inhabitants of rural communities, and older women are all poor. Although it is true that these populations are overrepresented among the poor, unless the variable of economic class is specifically evaluated, the broad nature of the problem may go unappreciated: the status of gynecologic cancers among the poor is primarily a reflection of a deeply rooted structural problem in the U.S. economy, the reverberations of which are experienced by all women who cannot afford regular health care. When women are poor and have gynecologic cancers, they often seek orthodox health care only after the symptoms have become unbearable. Explanations of this phenomenon include underlying feelings of pessimism, fatalism, or low self-esteem; faith in a belief system that does not regard the physician as the person to whom one goes for prevention or treatment of diseases; inaccessibility of health care facilities; experiences interpreted as degrading once health care facilities are accessed; high risk behavior and inability to pay.

Significant predictors of a history of more than one sexual partner included current pregnancy, Black race, and history of marijuana use; these three variables explained 78% of cases.  For unprotected intercourse, the only significant risk factor was current pregnancy (61% of cases).  AIDS knowledge did not decrease the likelihood of engaging in either high-risk behavior.  Compared to teen mothers, pregnant adolescents were less likely to have had multiple sex partners but more likely to have had unprotected intercourse.  These findings provide support for the theory of problem-proneness behavior, which asserts that those who engage in one high-risk behavior (e.g., initiating sex at an early age) are likely to engage in other, ecologically linked behaviors (e.g., marijuana use).  Interventions suggested by these results include stopping the progression of substance use (alcohol to marijuana to cocaine) among young mothers before experimentation with intravenous drugs occurs, social cognitive programs addressing hedonistic concerns about condom use, and education about the dangers of transmission of the AIDS virus to both mother and unborn child associated with unprotected sex during pregnancy.'",,,Brecht,M L,ML,,"UCLA School of Nursing, USA.",eng,,"Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,United States,Nurs Res,0376404,0029-6562,,,,0,0,ppublish,,7501487

The Regional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean has AIDS on its annual agenda.  By 1986, 12 of the 22 countries had 41 AIDS cases with most of cases in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.  Blood transfusion and imported blood products accounted for most initial AIDS cases.  By 1990, all 22 countries, except Afghanistan, had reported AIDS cases.  As of the end of the second quarter of 1991, there were a cumulative total of 2542 AIDS cases and 471 cases of AIDS related complex.  Under-recognition and under-reporting are likely to be common in these countries, so the actual cumulative number of AIDS cases is more likely to be 7000.  Nevertheless, it is clear that the number of AIDS cases is increasing annually.  HIV is now chiefly transmitted in-country.  Even though most AIDS cases (75%) are males, the proportion of HIV infected females is increasing.  90% of all AIDS cases is in the 15-49 year old age group.  Sexual transmission accounts for 90% of all cases.  Asymptomatic HIV seropositivity is rather common in blood donors, people seeking work permits, and groups with high risk behavior.  14 countries are conducting sentinel surveillance, chiefly centering on sexually transmitted disease (STD) patients attending public clinics.  These numbers are limited since most persons seek STD care from private practitioners.  WHO has not been able to convince health authorities in the Middle East of the need to differentiate between case finding and surveillance.  Saudi Arabia involves authorities from the Ministry of Health as well as those from the Ministry of Education, universities, industry, the media, and religious leaders.  More than 100 nongovernmental organizations in other Middle Eastern countries are involved in AIDS prevention and control.

Interleukin-2, a natural protein that induces CD8 cells to suppress the virus, is showing promising preliminary results. Another study, published in the December 1994 issue of AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses, suggests that a women infected with the virus thirteen years ago through a blood transfusion but who has little trace of the virus in her blood, is able to suppress all HIV viruses that infected her and only defective, slow-growing viruses have remained within her white cells.

We defined risk takers as men who engaged in receptive anal intercourse. About two-thirds of the men fall into this category in each year, and about half of those (one third of the total) engaged in unprotected anal intercourse. Most of these men seem to make implicit decisions in managing their risk for HIV. Men who engaged in receptive anal intercourse were more likely to be in a coupled relationship and to know their partners' HIV status. Alcohol and/or drug use during sex, earlier sexual experiences, and greater integration into the gay community were also related to receptive anal intercourse. By contrast, a significant minority of the men, about 6% of the sample, engaged in very high risk behavior in each year of the study-defined as unprotected receptive anal intercourse with multiple partners.

Heterosexual women have become one of the fastest-growing populations of newly diagnosed cases. However, the full impact of HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) on women's health and the optimal management of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases have yet to be delineated. The urgency to establish effective management protocols is underscored by the fact that AIDS has recently become the leading cause of death for minority women in many urban areas. The administration of antepartum and intrapartum zidovudine (azidothymidine, AZT) has advanced efforts to minimize perinatal transmission and produced promising results. However, important issues pertaining to prevention of HIV infection in women, mandatory testing of women of reproductive age, and the management of HIV-positive women during the interconceptional period remain controversial. Addressing HIV throughout the continuum of reproductive health is a major priority and a concern of all health care providers. Women's health care must assume the lead in counseling all women about their risk of HIV, ensuring that HIV-positive women make informed decisions about their reproductive health and that HIV-negative women modify high-risk behavior to avoid becoming infected. Since obstetricians and gynecologists, nurse practitioners, and midwives are often the first care providers whom at-risk and HIV-infected women contact, they must be able to identify, assess, and optimally manage these patients.

A Health Belief Model has been developed to bring about the necessary behavioral change to avoid AIDS.  The model can be divided into three major categories: 1) individual perceptions, 2) modifying factors, and 3) the probability of action.  Factors in the spread of HIV include sex, age, geography, interpersonal relationships and sex preferences (homo- and bisexuality), socioeconomic factors, peer pressure, awareness and knowledge about AIDS, and education/prevention.  The largest proportion of AIDS cases is in the 20-29 age group.  In the Sub-Saharan region 20-30% of all sexually active individuals in the age group of 20-40 years are infected with HIV.  In South Africa most AIDS cases are found in the 20-40 year age range.  From a geographical point of view, the spread of AIDS is heaviest in central, eastern, and southern Africa.  The interrelationship between socioeconomic factors and susceptibility to HIV infection has been proven.  Low economic status coupled with helplessness, psychological weakness, social isolation, and low income promote HIV infection.  Peer pressure and experimentation among youngsters with high risk behavior are also contributing factors.  AIDS awareness and education programs are the only means of prevention of the spreading of AIDS in the absence of drugs against AIDS.  School-based education programs could exert an influence on the knowledge level of students and induce behavioral change.  AIDS is also a disease of the poor, and 26 out of 35 of the poorest countries in the world are in Africa.

In Colombia, Mexico, and Jamaica, where condom distribution and/or information to prevent HIV transmission was integrated into the activities of family planning field workers, no negative effect on the image of condoms as a pregnancy prevention method was observed and there was a great demand on the part of family planning clients for information about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).  In Brazil, family planning staff are receiving training in HIV risk assessment and the counseling of women in partner negotiation skills.  However, steps must be taken to reach men since it is their high-risk behavior that puts most women at risk of HIV.  Both separate STD clinics for men and condom social marketing projects have yielded promising results.  Obstacles to the addition of STD services to family planning programs include the need to treat male partners as well as female clients, a shortage of diagnostic tools and antibiotics for treatment, and the fact that the majority of women with STDs are asymptomatic.  Indicative of the increased attention being given this approach, however, is the recent release of guidelines by the US Agency for International Development Office of Population on how family planning programs should approach integration.

Researchers aimed to test the factor structure of the Condom Use Self-Efficacy Scale (CUSES), which comprised 28 items in the questionnaire, and the ability of self-efficacy, high risk behavior, and demographic factors to differentiate among consistent condom users, sporadic users, and nonusers.  Sporadic users had significantly more sexual partners in the last 12 months than did consistent users (3.64 vs. 1.92; p  .005). This may be because sporadic users were more likely to use alcohol (CUSES score:  9.09 vs. 7.81; p  .05) and to lack confidence in their ability to use condoms when intoxicated (8.5 vs. 9.73; p  .005) than were consistent users.  Alcohol use had a consistent, positive correlation with number of sexual partners (p  .01), indicating the need for college health education programs that promote condom use to address alcohol abuse.  Nonusers were less likely to be confident of their ability to demand that their sexual partner use a condom than were consistent users (9.36 vs. 10.58; p  .005).  They were also more likely to fear partner's disapproval than consistent users (16.46 vs. 17.73; p  .05), but this was a more moderate difference than assertiveness. Thus, nonusers tended to be insecure in their abilities to discuss and insist on condom use and to negotiate and resolve any conflict about condom use.  Consistent users had better communication skills about intimate subjects than did nonusers.  Any health education program promoting safer sexual practices needs to address communication and improvement of relationship skills.

The World Health Organization (WHO) places the estimate of the number of people in India who are infected with HIV at around 1 million.  However, Jacob John of Vellore Medical College (who first discovered the virus in India) places the estimate at higher than 2.5 million with an increase to 9-18 million by the year 2000.

According to Obremskey, the number of AIDS cases will reach 650,000, of which 500,000 will die. Health care for full-blown AIDS costs $1016/yr, while lost productivity due to early death costs $22,000 per victim.  Myers, Mechai and Obremskey state that Thailand could prevent 3.5 million cases and save $5.1 billion, if people ceased high-risk behavior and the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases was given the highest priority.  In the Philippines there are only 416 reported cases of HIV and AIDS, but Dennis Maducduc of the Department of Health AIDS program states that Filipinos are secretive about this, and Orville Solon of the University of the Philippines suggests there are 100 cases for each reported case.

Researchers has not observed these barriers earlier in the AIDS epidemic.  Obstetrician-gynecologists (OB/GYNs) are often the first health providers to diagnose and treat HIV infection since HIV-infected women have a high rate of gynecological infections and malignancies. Many women first learn their HIV status after being treated during pregnancy.  Many HIV-infected women have no perceived risk factors and have acquired HIV via heterosexual transmission.  HIV infection does not appear to reduce fertility, adversely affect pregnancy outcome, or cause menstrual disturbance.

It is projected that the direct and indirect costs of infection per HIV-positive case in the Ivory Coast will total $20,079, and that the HIV vaccine will increase in cost by an estimated $5.28; the cost to fully immunize a child.  Full immunity will be conferred after 2 doses of vaccine.  Data were used with the allowance that at least 5% of a vaccine-eligible cohort of infants would become HIV-positive at approximately age 26.  The cost-benefit analysis varied cost, efficacy rates for the hypothetical vaccine, and HIV seroprevalence rates to determine the price per individual dose of vaccine at which immunization would cease being cost-effective.  The basic model was also expanded to include vaccinating young adults and the added benefits associated with decreased HIV transmission especially in individuals with high risk behavior.  Moreover, the effects of a changing discount rate were considered along with some of the problems with AIDS vaccine modeling.  Final analysis assuming a valid baseline EPI model of 5% HIV seroprevalence rate and a 60% vaccine efficacy rate, found costs to equal benefits at $462/dose; including the dynamic benefits, the price rises to $1287/dose.  AIDS, however, imposes an enormous economic burden upon individuals, households, communities, and countries.

The wide range of transmissible microbial agents exhibits different relative risks in different circumstances; therefore, the same safety rules are not always applicable.  TTIs can also exist as asymptomatic diseases in their hosts, so donors must be screened for high-risk behavior.  Then blood must be screened by detecting antibodies to infectious agents.  Since antibody reactivity is difficult to confirm, and cross-reactive or nonspecific effects are possible, a reactive sample can be tested by a range of assays, each based on a different immunoassay principle, or by a supplementary assay.  Despite the advanced nature of these tests, problems of indeterminate donors remain, and a compromise must be made between the sensitivity and specificity of screening assays; maximum sensitivity protects transfusion recipients, but specificity prevents wasting blood or making false reports about donor health.  An ideal screening assay would have maximum sensitivity, optimal specificity, simplicity, objectivity, standard format, rapid processing time, safety of reagents, and economy.  Assay users must chose the best combination of available characteristics for their particular situation.  For example, a French study found that 30% of seronegative, but HIV-infectious, donors are anti-HBc positive; this test would be too specific, however, in a country where hepatitis B is common.  Combined assays are being used to screen for anti-HIV-1 and -2 and anti-human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I and -II; this should save time and money.  Screening donors selectively (for example, Latin American migrants to North America for Trypanosoma cruzi) may protect previously unexposed populations.  In some countries, transmission of HIV via seronegative blood is a problem, and HIV antigen screening and confirmation of reactivity by neutralization should occur as soon as reagents become less expensive.  As test methodology continues to move through rapid developmental ""generations,"" the development of sensitive techniques to detect nucleic acids holds promise.  Several problems will remain to be solved including cost cross-contamination and carry-over in automated sampling systems, and operational and clerical errors.  While there are methods to inactivate viruses in plasma pools, inactivation must incur a minimal loss of biological activity.  All of these challenges are exacerbated in developing countries by a lack of resources.  As physicians become knowledgeable about when to use transfusion and when to use an alternative method, such as blood salvage, refusing transfusion will be more risky than contracting a TTI.'",,,Barbara,J A,JA,,"North London Blood Transfusion Centre, England.",eng,,Review,,,United States,Transfus Med Rev,8709027,0887-7963,,,,0,0,ppublish,,8481604

HIV risk behavior was measured on the basis of participation in anal-genital and oral-genital sex, sexual orientation, and syphilis serostatus.  High-risk behavior was found to be significantly positively associated with economic dependence on hustling, enjoyment of sex with tricks, and perceived control over hustling, negatively with frequency and quantity of substance abuse. These variables accounted for 6%, 3%, 4% and 4%, respectively, of the total variance in risk behavior.  96% of male prostitutes identified HIV as a serious condition; however, risk-taking behavior was found to increase with increased levels of perceived susceptibility to HIV infection.  Finally, risk-taking behaviors increased along with increased in perceptions of the availability and efficacy of condoms. These findings suggest that health education efforts based on promoting HIV infection as a serious condition or emphasizing the effectiveness of condom use will be ineffective without attention to the social context of population groups at greatest risk of HIV infection.

High risk behavior is assumed to be the result of heuristics used to make judgments under uncertain conditions.  Heuristic reasoning has the potential for being mobilized for increasing use of safer sex practices.  Mass media messages should portray AIDS and HIV infections as dangerous to people who are sexually active and have multiple partners or have a partner who is sexually active and has multiple partners.  The reasoning is that the appearance of more mainstream AIDS conditions will make AIDS more apparent, representative, and come to mind during decision making about safe sex practices.  Lottery ticket buying follows this reasoning, where the chances are slim for winning but many engage in buying tickets.  The parallel to safe sex is that many people use safe sex even though the chances are low of contracting the AID virus.  Another approach is to publicize the probability of having an HIV positive sexual partner, if there are multiple sexual contacts.  This approach reinforces the statistic about the number of AIDS cases out of the total population.  Optimistic reasoning is the culprit in high risk decision making, and it allows for relapses in safe sex behavior or lack of safe sex practices.  Proposals are made to mainstream HIV/AIDS cases and to establish a safer sex norm.  The aim is to eliminate individual decision making which poses a threat of rejection for bringing up the topic of safe sex or desexualizing a spontaneous or unplanned experience.  The discussion of motivated reasoning relies on the theories of Kunda on motivated reasoners and behavior change and Fineberg's evidence of dramatic declines in sexually transmitted diseases during World War II due to appropriate public health campaigns.  Decision making heuristics is also presented in the discussion the studies by Kahnemann, Slovic, and Tversky on judgment under uncertainty.

In the 1930s, condoms began to be made with latex and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released its first quality control standards for condoms.  The Army distributed condoms during World War II despite objections by church groups.  Oral contraceptives and changing mores in the 1960s hurt the condom market.  STD incidence increased.  AIDS brought condoms back to the forefront during the 1980s.  In 1987, the FDA began to test latex condoms for leaks which resulted in improved quality condoms.  Nevertheless, condom use does not equal protection from STDs, HIV, and pregnancy and largely depends on correct and consistent use.  Some people are allergic to the latex, lubricants, and perfumes, however.  A female condom is expected to reach the market soon.  In many countries, groups are promoting by using colorful and humorous marketing gimmicks.  For example, an animated condom donning a soccer jersey entertained audiences at the world cup games.  Sweden and Thailand use Proud Pete, a condom clad penis, to promote condom use.  In the US, schools, AIDS activists, and clergy distribute condoms to prevent HIV transmission.  Today there are at least 108 different condoms brands in the US with catchy names such as Blacky, Skin Less Skin Crown, and Rough Rider.'",,,Salem,A,A,,"Sioux Falls VAMC, SD.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,S D J Med,0040162,,,,,0,0,ppublish,,1439722

In areas of the world where HBV infection occurs predominantly in infants and young children, routine infant immunization with hepatitis B vaccine is the most appropriate vaccination strategy. In the United States, the majority of HBV infections occur in adults with behaviors or occupations that put them at risk for HBV infection. Nevertheless, infection acquired during infancy and early childhood contributes significantly to the burden of chronic liver disease in the United States. Until recently, the vaccination strategy in the United States has included HBsAg screening of pregnant women and vaccination of infants born to infected women and vaccination of people in groups at high risk for HBV infection. Because of the difficulties in accessing and vaccinating persons from high-risk groups and the recent findings that HBV infection occurs more commonly among children in some groups in the United States than previously appreciated, the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee of the US Public Health Service and the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1991 endorsed a strategy of universal immunization of infants for hepatitis B. This strategy has the advantages of accessing infants in the United States through preexisting vaccine delivery systems and vaccinating individuals prior to their engaging in high-risk behavior.

Also, as edentulism decreases and as more teeth are retained by the elderly, the pattern of oral diseases and the treatment of dental conditions will be altered. Barriers to self-care and professional care must be removed, and prevention and early intervention strategies must be formulated to reduce the risk of oral disease. Risk factors for oral diseases in the elderly can be reduced by personal home-care regimens, professionally provided preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic care, changes in high-risk behavior, and a supportive environment.

A research agenda for the elderly should include: epidemiologic studies of relevant oral diseases and related risk factors; investigations of patient and provider attitudes and behavior related to oral health; studies of the relationship between general health and oral health; development and testing of preventive and treatment strategies for conditions such as xerostomia, root caries, secondary caries, and gingival recession; and studies for the evaluation of the impact of the aging population on the dental delivery system. Public policy options to support geriatric oral health care and research are limited by the Government's pre-occupation with cost containment and the lack of visibility for dental programs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""",,,Gershen,J A,JA,,"School of Dentistry, University of California-Los Angeles.",eng,,Review,,,United States,Adv Dent Res,8802131,0895-9374,,,,0,0,ppublish,,10.1177/08959374910050011101

Resisters of unsafe sex urges reported active cognitive self-guidance, experience in safe sex, and recall of both AIDS fears and safety benefits as their most important coping strategies.

Coexisting HIV infection is believed responsible for the soaring incidence of tuberculosis in Africa, and for the increase in the number of reported cases in the United States. As HIV-induced immunosuppression worsens, tuberculosis may supervene by reactivation of remotely acquired infection or failure to defend against newly acquired Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Both mechanisms undoubtedly occur in Africa where the rate of exposure is high; the former prevails in the United States. The risk of tuberculous infection progressing to tuberculous disease is about six times higher in HIV seropositive than seronegative persons. Although not incontrovertibly established, tuberculosis probably also has a deleterious effect on coexisting HIV infection, either by accelerating the rate of destruction of CD4+ lymphocytes and/or promoting the release of new virions from HIV-infected macrophages. Tuberculosis, whether HIV-linked or not, can be controlled by the traditional means of case-finding and treatment, vaccination with BCG, and chemoprophylaxis.

An intact condom is an effective barrier against HIV but in surveys in several countries, around 30% of homosexual men report having experienced failures in condoms during anal sex.  Data on the failure rate in vaginal sex is less consistent but seems to lie in the 1-5% range.

The two most important components of a control program are (1) the National Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance project and (2) treatment with ceftriaxone, 125 or 250 mg intramuscularly, which is active against all known types of resistance and will cure all forms of uncomplicated gonorrhea, including the more difficult-to-treat infections of the pharynx and anorectum. Fear of AIDS has had a powerful motivating effect on sexual behavior, and in the United States has been associated with an overall reduction in incidence of gonorrhea in homosexual men of over 95%. After peaking in 1985, incidence of gonorrhea in white heterosexual men and women has declined as well. A diagnosis of gonorrhea in 1990 implies recent high-risk behavior for acquiring HIV infection.

There was a sexual partner with known positive HIV-antibody status or AIDS in 33.9%, and in 32.4% there was a history of sexual activity in the USA. In the year before the test, 18.8% had had more than 50 partners. All these behavioral characteristics were found to be significantly correlated to HIV antibodies. We noted a substantial reduction of high-risk behavior from 1983 to 1987. The most important behavioral factor for HIV infection in 1983 and 1984 was sexual activity in the USA, and from 1984 to 1987, the numbers of lifetime partners. Persons infected with HIV were significantly more often carriers of antibodies against HAV, HBV, CMV, EBV, and syphilis. Prevalence of antibodies against HIV, HAV, HBV, and syphilis increased with age, duration of homosexual practice, and the number of partners. Overall crude prevalence rates of HIV antibodies, anti-HBc, anti-HAV, and antibodies to syphilis declined during the observation period.

In early 1986, no clinical AIDS case had been diagnosed in Ghana.  1 of 98 prostitutes living near Accra was infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).  By the end of 1986, 72 Ghanians were infected with the virus, 63 of them women.  This 1st pilot project's strategy was to test the feasibility of an attempt to stop the spread of HIV infection in Accra by increasing spermicide and condom use among sex workers.  Discussions were organized with small groups of female prostitutes.  An informal communication network already existed among them.  Most had heard of AIDS, but did not know how it was transmitted.  They thought that they were at risk, but did not know what to do about it.  The discussions led to making 6 women leaders or peer educators.  After being trained, these peer educators talked with 72 other prostitutes and gave them spermicides and condoms free of charge.  In June, 1987, 72 prostitutes took a knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) survey on AIDS/HIV and sex practices.  In January, 1988, only 45 of the original 72 completed the follow-up interview.  Before the project, 1 in 3 women (among the original 72) understood that they could get the disease from an apparently healthy man; at the end, 9 out of 10 understood this.  Reported use of spermicides and/or condoms with customers increased greatly.  Only 9 of 72 (13%) reported regular use of spermicides or condoms in the beginning.  6 months later, 89% said they used spermicides and/or condoms regularly.  There are some problems with the results.  More women wanted to get into the project as word spread about the purpose of the condoms.  Another 144 prostitutes were enrolled in a supplementary program.  This group bought the condoms at wholesale prices.

The Caribbean are a collection of numerous cultures, languages, politics, and economies.  It has a high number of AIDS cases relative to it\'s population size.  At the onset of the AIDS epidemic, a series of bad studies led to the conclusion that Haitians were a ""risk group"" for HIV infection, consequences of which are irreparable.  The AIDS epidemic has been characterized by attitudes of fear, and resentment of HIV infected persons.  For instance, AIDS victims are totally excluded from controversial AIDS related discussions.  Whereas in Trinidad and Tobago, widespread promotion of condoms is ongoing to control the spread of HIV infection.  Cuba on the other hand, has tested most of it\'s population for HIV infection, and those who are infected have been isolated into medically equipped buildings.  This approach, though effective, cannot be sustained by any other island in the Caribbean.  In fact, issues of routine hospital blood screening tend to be problematic given the very low seroprevalence rates relative to the resources needed for testing.  In all islands however, there is a drive to keep the blood supply free of HIV infection, and health workers well educated on AIDS related facts.

When compared to the safer ones, these 17 showed no less knowledge about transmission. But there were clear differences between the two groups regarding their social situation, the most important of these being the lack of social network and a supporting environment among most of the 17. Sexuality then becomes the main way to close contact with others, and this makes them dread changing, and makes them deny the anxiety they feel. Further, safer sex is often experienced as emotionally colder, as expressions of distrust, and as a reminder of death. To receive the semen is traditionally valued as a commitment to the partner.

Among subjects engaged in high-risk behavior at intake, those who injected less or were enrolled in drug abuse treatment were more likely to stop high-risk drug injecting. Subjects who (at intake) engaged in less frequent unprotected sex, or who had had sex with someone with AIDS, were more likely to stop high-risk sexual behavior. The majority of subjects at low risk at intake maintained low-risk behavior. Informational interventions appear to be most successful among those IVDUs already engaging in lower levels of risk behavior.

Even though there is no vaccine or effective treatment, HIV infection can be prevented through behavioral change. As the lead Public Health Service Agency for disease prevention, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has designed and implemented information and education activities with the ultimate goal of preventing HIV infection and AIDS in the United States. The target populations include the general public, school- and college-aged populations, persons infected or at increased risk of infection, minorities, and health workers. Because AIDS will be with us for a long time, CDC views educating the public as a long-term undertaking. The agency has initiated an intensive continuing national public information campaign, an informational brochure to be distributed to every U.S. household, a national AIDS information toll-free hotline, and a clearinghouse system that will maintain a comprehensive inventory of AIDS information resources and services. CDC also supports public information and education efforts by State and local health agencies. To reach school- and college-age youth, CDC, in consultation with governmental and national private sector organizations, developed guidelines for effective school health education to assist school health personnel in determining the scope and content of AIDS education. CDC also works with State and local education agencies to help carry out and evaluate educational efforts to prevent the spread of HIV among school- and college-age youth. The populations with the highest priority for AIDS information and education efforts are those who are at increased risk of acquiring or transmitting the AIDS virus because they use illicit intravenous drugs and share needles, engage in anal intercourse, have many sexual partners, practice prostitution, or engage in sex with those who practice these behaviors. Another high-priority population, because they can infect their offspring,is reproductive age women engaging in high-risk behavior and women infected with HIV who become pregnant. CDC programs targeted to these groups include community health education and risk reduction interventions, counseling and testing for HIV infection, AIDS community demonstration projects, perinatal AIDS prevention projects,and programs focused on preventing AIDS in minority populations. CDC is developing a variety of educational approaches for health workers in clinical settings because they are an important channel for providing accurate AIDS information, helping to assess risk, and counseling to actively reduce risk for the patient, sex partners of the patient, friends, and family members of the patient. CDC has conducted research and provided information and training on the use of HIV laboratory tests. CDC has also developed numerous scientific and technical guidelines and recommendations in consultation with practitioners, public health officials, and others and disseminated these through the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. In addition,CDC has provided information about the risk of HIV transmission in the workplace and about methods of prevention. CDC will continue to evaluate these activities and support research in education and related interventions that may be necessary to prevent infection by the HIV virus. By providing educational support for behavior changes that decrease HIV transmission, we can contribute to AIDS prevention in the 1990s.'",,,Rosenberg,M L,ML,,"Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta, GA 30333.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,Public Health Rep,9716844,0033-3549,,,,0,0,ppublish,,PMC1478064

HIV-seropositivity rates were higher among men (6.3 percent) than women (3.0 percent) (P less than 0.001) and among blacks (5.0 percent) than whites (1.2 percent) (P less than 0.02). Among men, but not women, HIV seroprevalence increased markedly and steadily up to the age of 40. In men, HIV seropositivity was independently associated with increased age, black race, a history of homosexual contact, and the use of parenteral drugs. In women, a history of parenteral drug use or of being a sexual partner of a bisexual man or parenteral drug user were independently predictive of HIV seropositivity. In men, HIV seropositivity was also associated with a history of syphilis or a reactive serologic test for syphilis, and in women, with a history of genital warts. Since these associations were independent of the type and number of reported sexual partners, they raise the possibility that sexually transmitted diseases that disrupt epithelial surfaces may be important in the transmissibility of HIV. In addition, on a self-administered questionnaire, one third of HIV-infected men and one half of infected women did not acknowledge previous high-risk behavior for HIV exposure. These data suggest that patients at clinics for sexually transmitted diseases represent a group at high risk for HIV infection, and that screening, counseling, and intensive education should be offered to all patients attending such clinics.'",,,Hook,E W,EW,,"Laboratory of Immunoregulation, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Md.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,N Engl J Med,0255562,0028-4793,,,,0,0,ppublish,,10.1056/NEJM198801283180401

Seroprevalence of HIV among drug users has remained at about 30% in the U.S. and parts of Europe, while lower in Asia and South America.  There is now evidence from several places in Europe and the U.S. that many iv drug users will change drug injecting behavior to avoid AIDS.  A conceptual model of new social norms needed to change behavior involves 3 stages:  knowing the dangers of AIDS, having the means to change behavior (treatment or clean syringes), and a mechanism to reinforce the new behavior (perceived efficacy or social approval).  There is no evidence that safer injection programs either keep users from going to treatment or increase numbers of users.  In contrast, there is no evidence for improved sexual risk-taking behaviors among users, a fact which argues for stronger efforts to prevent already infected users from spreading HIV.  The public, policy-markers, and researchers are unaware that seroprevalence of HIV varies with the type of drug injected (cocaine; heroin; amphetamine), and with socioeconomic status of the user (ethnic minority; majority).  The clinical presentation, infection rate, persistence of infection, and mortality rate among iv drug users differs from that of the general AIDS population.

It also includes blood screening, improved sterile procedures, improved surveillance and notification, research and terminal patient care. The plan stresses integration based on primary health care.

Of those still sharing needles at the time of first becoming aware of AIDS, 63% reported having subsequently either stopped needle-sharing or ceased IV drug use entirely. Logistic regression analysis indicated that continued needle-sharing behavior was associated with the detention facility site and lower scores on an AIDS knowledge questionnaire; reduced needle-sharing was more evident among methadone program patients and among subjects with greater knowledge about AIDS. The most common reasons for continued needle-sharing among those who continued to share needles despite knowledge of risk were: 'need to inject drugs, with no clean needle available' and 'only share with close friend or relative', offered by 46 and 45% of subjects, respectively. Results suggest that certain subgroups of IV drug users have adopted risk-reduction measures in response to AIDS.

The 2nd chapter assesses the prospects for development of a vaccine, the difficulty of determining the lethality of HIV infection after only a few years of experience, and the efficacy of AZT, alpha interferon, and other possible treatments.  Existing epidemiologic data, the divergent transmission pattern in different world regions and their recent trends, high risk behavior, the probable future course of the epidemic, and possible social and economic effects of the epidemic are discussed in chapter 3.  The following chapter discusses AIDS prevention campaigns, safer sex, condom use, and IEC campaigns for the public, with examples from Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, the US, and elsewhere.  Chapter 5 focuses on the epidemic in Africa.  Topics covered include the possible African origin of HIV, the deficiencies of existing epidemiologic data, AIDS control programs in Africa, and special problems in Africa related to the possibility of infection during lactation and the possible dangers of vaccinating children seropositive for HIV.

Reduction of sexual and IV transmission of HTLV-III/LAV should be enhanced by using available serologic tests to give asymptomatic, infected individuals in high-risk groups the opportunity to know their status so they can take appropriate steps to prevent the further transmission of this virus.  Since the objective of these additional recommendations is to help interrupt transmission by encouraging testing and counseling among persons in high-risk groups, careful attention must be paid to maintaining confidentiality and to protecting records from any unauthorized disclosure.  The ability of health departments to assure confidentiality, and the public confidence in that ability, are crucial to efforts to increase the number of persons requesting such testing and counseling.  Persons at increased risk of HTLV-III/LAV infection include:  homosexual and bisexual men; present or past IV drug abusers; persons with clinical or laboratory evidence of infection, such as those with signs or symptoms compatible with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC); persons born in countries where heterosexual transmission is thought to play a major role; male or female prostitutes and their sex partners; sex partners of infected persons or persons at increased risk; all persons with hemophilia who have received clotting-factor products; and newborn infants of high-risk or infected mothers.  Recommendations include:  community health education programs should be aimed at members of high-risk groups to increase knowledge of AIDS, to facilitate behavioral changes to reduce risks of HTLV-III/LAV infection, and encourage voluntary testing and counseling; counseling and voluntary serologic testing for HTLV-III/LAV should be routinely offered to all persons at increased risk when they present to health care settings; infected patients should be encouraged to refer sex partners or persons with whom they have shared needles to their health care providers for evaluation and/or testing; persons with a negative test should be counseled about their need for continued evaluation to monitor their infection status if they continue high-risk behavior; state and local health officials should evaluate the implications of requiring the reporting of repeatedly reactive HTLV-III/LAV antibody test results to the state health department; and state or local action is appropriate on public health grounds to regulate or close establishments where there is evidence that they facilitate high-risk behaviors.'",,,,,,,,eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,7802429,0149-2195,,,,0,0,ppublish,,3005822

Our findings support the view that this group is at substantially greater risk of health problems and early mortality than the general population. Fewer than half of migrant children under age 16 received the recommended annual physical checkup. Only one-third of migrant children under age 16 had received an annual dental checkup compared to 50% of children in the total population. A rough comparison between levels of chronic health conditions for migrant children and those reported for children in a national survey suggest that the incidence of chronic conditions is several times greater among migrant children. Childhood mortality appears to be 1.6 times higher than in the U.S. population. In analyzing variation in preventive care for migrant children, younger children are more likely to receive checkups, while older children are more likely to receive immunizations. In interpreting this finding, we suggest distinguishing between two types of preventive care: one under the direct control of the family, and the other controlled by the schools. Since immunizations are given to migrant children in schools, the older or school-age children are more likely to be immunized. In assessing reports of chronic conditions, we noted that mothers who spoke English were more likely to report that a child had a chronic condition. One possible interpretation is that women who do not speak English may not label various childhood conditions as chronic illnesses. Since a large proportion of women spoke only Spanish, the chronic conditions may be substantially under-reported among migrant children. The analysis of childhood mortality shows the level of mortality to be proportionally lower among women who spoke English, and higher among those who gave birth to a low birth weight child. But surprisingly, the most important characteristic related to loss of children was whether or not a mother smoked. Using smoking as one example of high risk behavior, we suggest that future studies should give closer attention to the impact of parental risk-taking behaviors on childhood morbidity and mortality experiences.'",,,Cautley,E,E,,,eng,,"Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,England,Soc Sci Med,8303205,0277-9536,,,,0,0,ppublish,,3749965

In high mortality countries, environmental factors may reduce or cancel out the biological advantages that women enjoy over men.  As mortality is reduced through improved nutrition, public health measures, and better health care and education, women's environmental disadvantage is reduced and genetic-biological factors may increase the female life span faster than that of males.  In the 3rd phase of this process, life style factors (e.g. alcohol abuse, cigarette smoking) may become increasingly detrimental to male health and survival, leading female mortality to decline at a faster pace than that of males.  Although males appear to have adapted less well than women to the stresses of modernization, there has been a trend toward high risk behavior patterns among women too as a result of the changing female role.  Prospects for the future trend of sex differentials in developed societies depend largely on developments in 2 areas:  the effective treatment of degenerative and chronic diseases, which dominate the cause-of-death structure in these societies; and prevention through health education and encouragement of changes in personal behavior and life style.  The challenge for women is to resist pressures to adopt a hazardous life style (e.g. smoking) that might offset the benefits of their improved social status.""",,,Lopez,A D,AD,,,eng,,Journal Article,,,Switzerland,WHO Chron,0414010,0042-9694,,,,0,0,ppublish,,6528584

The study was based on the assumption that ""difficult to manage"" patients with heart disease, ie, those who failed to modify their high-risk behavior patterns following a cardiac event--and their families, in their attempts to deal with the threat of heart attack, would interact with one another in a manner which would maintain, however unintentionally, the patient\'s high-risk behavior pattern. Nine such ""difficult heart families"" were referred to the project. In each case the patient\'s wife was seen individually for a maximum of five clinical interviews for the purpose of modifying her method of dealing with, and presumably maintaining, her husband\'s high-risk behaviors. Contact with the patient with heart disease was minimal and used for information-gathering only. In each case, when the wife made the prescribed changes in dealing with her husband, a desirable change in one or more of his high-risk behaviors followed.'",,,Hoebel,F C,FC,,,eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,J Fam Pract,7502590,0094-3509,,,,0,0,ppublish,,1003133
