However, inadequate awareness of climate change-related occupational heat stress risks and adaptation strategies have been shown to render occupational heat stress management ineffective. A concurrent mixed-methods approach was used to assess the perceptions of climate change and occupational heat stress risks and adaptation strategies of mining workers among supervisory personnel and other stakeholders in Ghana. Questionnaires and interviews were used to elicit data from 19 respondents. Data were processed and interpreted using descriptive statistics, chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, and thematic analysis. Supervisors' climate change risks perception was adequate, and their concern about workplace heat exposure risks was moderate. Mining workers' occupational heat stress risks experiences were linked to heat-related illness and minor injuries. Mining workers' adaptation strategies included water intake, use of cooling mechanisms, work-break practices, and clothing use. The related differences in job experience in the distribution of climate change risk perception and occupational heat stress risk experiences, and the difference in educational attainment in the distribution of adaptation strategies of occupational heat stress were significant (p<0.05).

Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a form of As commonly found in drinking water and in some foods. Overwhelming evidence suggest that people chronically exposed to iAs are at risk of developing cancer, or cardiovascular, neurological and metabolic diseases. Although the mechanisms underlying iAs-associated illness remain poorly characterized, a growing body of literature raises the possibility that microRNAs (miRNAs), post-transcriptional gene suppressors, may serve as mediators and/or early indicators of the pathologies associated with iAs exposure. To characterize the circulating miRNA profiles of individuals chronically exposed to iAs, samples of plasma were collected from 109 healthy residents of the city of Zimapn and the Lagunera area in Mexico, the regions with historically high exposures to iAs in drinking water. These plasma samples were analyzed for small RNAs using high-throughput sequencing, and for iAs and its methylated metabolites. Associations between plasma levels of arsenic species and miRNAs were evaluated. Six circulating miRNAs (miRs-423-5p, -142-5p -2, -423-5p +1, -320c-1, -320c-2, and -454-5p), two of which have been previously linked to cardiovascular disease and diabetes (miRs-423-5p, -454-5p), were found to be significantly correlated with plasma MAs.

Other studies examined participation and behavior change in low- (e.g., wellness coaching) or high-intensity lifestyle modification programs (e.g., diabetes prevention program-like interventions) offered by payers or employers. Lastly, studies assessed how employer health insurance benefits impacted healthcare utilization, adherence, and outcomes among people with diabetes.

Health plans that incentivize patient behaviors were associated with increases in medication adherence. Meanwhile, shifting patients to high-deductible health plans was associated with no change in medication use and preventive screenings, but patients with diabetes delayed accessing healthcare for acute complications (e.g., cellulitis).

Inflammation, oxidative stress and lipid metabolism seem to be the most important factors in the pathogenesis of the disease. The importance of genetic factors has mainly been revealed with the influence of histocompatibility complement factor H (CFH) variations and the ARSM2 susceptibility gene. Another component, epigenetics, could help to explain some of the relationships between environmental and genetic factors. Epigenetics is defined as the study of modulations of gene activity that can be transmitted over cell divisions without involving mutation of the DNA sequence. The molecules that are involved in these mechanisms are referred to as the epigenome. The mechanisms involve DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and gene inhibition by non-coding RNA. Epigenetics could explain how the environment may induce relatively stable changes in traits or even diseases, possibly inheritable over several generations. Epigenetic traits established during development, and/or acquired under the influence of nutritional factors or other environmental factors, could influence the interactions between genes and the environment. Several authors have recently shown the influence of epigenetic factors in the pathogenesis of ocular diseases such as cataract, dry eye, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and more recently AMD. A better understanding of the involvement of genetic variants at risk, their relationship with epigenetics and environmental factors would certainly help to better assess the risk of developing AMD or better understand recent changes in the incidence of the disease.'",,,Desmettre,T,T,,"Centre de rétine médicale, 187, rue de Menin, 59520 Marquette-Lez-Lille, France; London International Medical Centre, 18-22 Queen Anne Street, London, W1G 8HU, Royaume-Uni.

Due to recent changes in healthcare policies, patient-centered outcomes including return to work have been increasingly prioritized by physicians and hospitals to optimize healthcare delivery. In this study, the authors used a national spine registry to identify clinical factors associated with return to work at 3 months among patients undergoing a cervical spine surgery.METHODSThe authors queried the Quality Outcomes Database registry for information collected from April 2013 through March 2017 for preoperatively employed patients undergoing cervical spine surgery for degenerative spine disease. Covariates included demographic, clinical, and operative variables, and baseline patient-reported outcomes. Multiple imputations were used for missing values and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with higher odds of returning to work. Bootstrap resampling (200 iterations) was used to assess the validity of the model. A nomogram was constructed using the results of the multivariable model.RESULTSA total of 4689 patients were analyzed, of whom 82.2% (n = 3854) returned to work at 3 months postoperatively. Among previously employed and working patients, 89.3% (n = 3443) returned to work compared to 52.3% (n = 411) among those who were employed but not working (e.g., were on a leave) at the time of surgery (p < 0.001). On multivariable logistic regression the authors found that patients who were less likely to return to work were older (age > 56-65 years: OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.85, p < 0.001; age > 65 years: OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-0.97, p = 0.02); were employed but not working (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.20-0.29, p < 0.001); were employed part time (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.76, p < 0.001); had a heavy-intensity (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.32-0.54, p < 0.001) or medium-intensity (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46-0.76, p < 0.001) occupation compared to a sedentary occupation type; had workers' compensation (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28-0.53, p < 0.001); had a higher Neck Disability Index score at baseline (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.51-0.70, p = 0.017); were more likely to present with myelopathy (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.42-0.63, p < 0.001); and had more levels fused (3-5 levels: OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35-0.61, p < 0.001). Using the multivariable analysis, the authors then constructed a nomogram to predict return to work, which was found to have an area under the curve of 0.812 and good validity.CONCLUSIONSReturn to work is a crucial outcome that is being increasingly prioritized for employed patients undergoing spine surgery.

For example, BRCA1/2-associated cancers usually demonstrate somatic loss of the remaining gene allele, and, hence, tumor-specific defects of DNA repair of double-strand breaks. This mechanism determines increased sensitivity of BRCA1/2-related cancers to cisplatin, mitomycin C and PARP inhibitors.

Consequently, mind wandering might be a precursor for cognitive vulnerability in individuals who are at-risk for mood disorders. The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency and nature of mind wandering in women using OC in comparison to two control groups: naturally cycling women and men. We recruited 71 participants (28 women currently using OC, 14 naturally cycling women in the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle and 29 men) aged between 18 and 35 years, and measured the frequency and nature (guilt/fear oriented and positive) of mind wandering using the short version of the Imaginal Process Inventory. In all analyses, we controlled for depressive symptoms to delineate the unique association between OC use and mind wandering. We also measured estradiol, progesterone and testosterone to confirm expected group differences in sex hormones concentrations. Results show that women using OC presented increased frequency of mind wandering when compared to naturally cycling women and men who did not differ between each other. The three groups did not differ in terms of the nature of mind wandering. These results show that OC use is associated with increased frequency of mind wandering and suggest that the association between OC use and dysphoric mood described in previous studies may be partially explained by the impact of OC use on cognitive processes underlying mind wandering.'",,,Lupien,Sonia J,SJ,,"Centre for Studies on Human Stress, Institut universitaire en santé mentale de Montréal, Research Centre, CIUSSS East, Montréal, Québec, Canada; Department of Psychology Université du Québec à Montréal, Canada.",eng,,Journal Article,,,England,Psychoneuroendocrinology,7612148,0306-4530,,,,6,0,aheadofprint,,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.11.005

Coping with anxiety may be particularly difficult among individuals with a history of abuse as it is often linked to higher pain severity and poorer coping skills. We explored whether abuse history moderated the association between anxiety and benzodiazepine use among current opioids users. New patients at a tertiary-care, outpatient pain clinic completed self-report measures of medication use, anxiety, and physical and sexual abuse history (child abuse only, adult abuse only, or cumulative abuse). The present study included adult patients reporting current opioid use (n=1,785). Approximately 16% reported co-use of benzodiazepines and 17% reported a history of abuse. Patients reporting child abuse only and cumulative abuse reported co-use of benzodiazepines and opioids more often than those denying abuse and patients reporting adult abuse only (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that the probability of benzodiazepine use among patients reporting cumulative abuse increased sharply at high levels of anxiety (p=0.003). Cumulative abuse may increase sensitivity to psychological distress and put patients at risk for co-use. Providers should be aware of life history factors, including abuse, that may drive the need for medication. Perspective: This article examines the association between history of abuse victimization and co-use of benzodiazepines among chronic pain patients reporting current opioid use.

We calculated the proportion of loyalty card customers (n ~ 10 million) within Lower Super Output Areas who purchased the following medicines: 'coughs and colds', 'Hayfever', 'pain relief' and 'sun preps'. Machine learning was used to explore how 50 sociodemographic and health accessibility features were associated towards explaining purchasing of each product group. Random Forests are used as a baseline and Gradient Boosting as our final model. Our results showed that pain relief was the most common medicine purchased. There was little difference in purchasing behaviours by sex other than for sun preps. The gradient boosting models demonstrated that socioeconomic status of areas, as well as air pollution, were important predictors of each medicine. Our study adds to the self-medication literature through demonstrating the usefulness of loyalty card records for producing insights about how self-medication varies at the national level. Big data offer novel insights that add to and address issues that traditional studies are unable to consider. New forms of data through data linkage may offer opportunities to improve current public health decision making surrounding at risk population groups within self-medication behaviours.""",,,Singleton,Alex D,AD,,"Geographic Data Science Lab, Department of Geography & Planning, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,PLoS One,101285081,1932-6203,,,,6,0,epublish,,PONE-D-18-15648

Participants (n = 570) were women at risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy recruited from high risk settings. Profile analyses compared end-of-treatment (i.e., 3 months postintake) TTM construct mean profiles for women who reduced drinking to below NIAAA-defined risk levels1 (changers) with women who continued to drink at risk levels (nonchangers) at the 9-month follow-up. TTM construct profiles included experiential and behavioral processes of change, pros and cons for change, confidence to reduce drinking, and temptation to drink above risk levels. Results revealed a parallelism effect or interaction (p < .001) in the end-of-treatment TTM construct profiles for the changers versus the nonchangers at the 9-month follow-up. Changers reported greater pros (p < .001) and lower cons for change (p = .012), greater confidence (p = .030), lower temptation (p < .001) and greater use of the experiential (p < .001) and behavioral processes of change (p < .001).

Currently, the definite diagnosis is made only by the histological examination of a biopsy obtained through an invasive thoracoscopy. However, diagnosis is made too late for curative treatment because of non-specific symptoms mainly appearing at advanced stage disease. Hence, due to its biologic aggressiveness and the late diagnosis, survival rate is low and the patients\' outcome poor. In addition, radiological imaging, like computed tomographic scans, and blood biomarkers are found not to be sensitive enough to be used as an early diagnostic tool. Detection in an early stage is assumed to improve the patients\' outcome but is hampered due to non-specific and late symptomology. Hence, there is a need for a new screening and diagnostic test which could improve the patients\' outcome. Despite extensive research has focused on blood biomarkers, not a single has been shown clinically useful, and therefore research recently shifted to ""breathomics"" techniques to recognize specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath of the patient as potential non-invasive biomarkers for disease. In this review, we summarize the acquired knowledge about using breath analysis for diagnosing and monitoring MPM and asbestos-related disorders (ARD). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the gold standard of breath analysis, appears to be the method with the highest accuracy (97%) to differentiate MPM patients from at risk asbestos-exposed subjects. There have already been found some interesting biomarkers that are significantly elevated in asbestosis (NO, 8-isoprostane, leukotriene B4, -Pinene) and MPM (cyclohexane) patients. Regrettably, the different techniques and the plethora of studies suffer some limitations. Most studies are pilot studies with the inclusion of a limited number of patients. Nevertheless, given the promising results and easy sampling methods, we can conclude that breath analysis may become a useful tool in the future to screen for MPM, but further research is warranted.'",,,Lamote,Kevin,K,,"Internal Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.",eng,,Review,,,China,Transl Lung Cancer Res,101646875,2218-6751,,,,6,1,ppublish,,PMC6204411

Ten cadaveric specimens were used. The dorsalis pedis artery and deep peroneal nerve were free from injury in 9 of 10 specimens. In those 9 specimens, the neurovascular bundle was located dorsal in relation to the screw. The mean distance of the screw to the neurovascular bundle was 7.1  3.3 mm.

Results showed that probiotic and butyrate-producing microbes increased their relative abundance, whereas proinflammatory strains exhibited suppressed relative abundance following CR. Analyses of the gut microbial and host metabolisms revealed that most host microbial co-metabolites were changed due to CR. Examples of dramatic CR-induced changes in host metabolism included a decrease in the rate of lipid biosynthesis and an increase in the rates of fatty acid catabolism, -oxidation, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis.

The objectives of this study were to report the frequency of seizure occurring while driving, clarify patient characteristics and analyze the behavioral patterns of drivers afflicted by seizure. A single-center, retrospective study was conducted using prospectively acquired data. Data of 658 adult seizure patients who visited our emergency department between January 2011 and December 2016 were used for analysis, focusing on daily activities immediately before seizure. Nineteen of the 658 patients (2.9%) sustained seizure while driving. The 658 patients were dichotomized on the basis of whether he or she had been diagnosed with epileptic seizure (ES). Seven of the 307 patients with ES vs. 12 of the 351 patients without ES sustained seizure while driving. The frequencies did not differ significantly between the two groups (2.3% vs. 3.4%, p=0.49).

The aim was to better understand people's information needs by starting with what they do not know, discovered through their own questions, rather than starting with what we know about T2DM and subsequently finding ways to communicate that information to people affected by or at risk of the disease. One hundred and sixty-four questions were collected from 120 patients attending outpatient diabetes clinics and 300 questions from 100 members of the public through the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. Twenty-three general and diabetes-specific topics and five phases of disease progression were identified; these were used to manually categorize the questions. Analyses were performed to determine which topics, if any, were significant predictors of a question's being asked by a patient or the public, and similarly for questions from a woman or a man. Further analysis identified the individual topics that were assigned significantly more often to the crowdsourced or clinic questions. These were Causes (CI: [-0.07, -0.03], p < .001), Risk Factors ([-0.08, -0.03], p < .001), Prevention ([-0.06, -0.02], p < .001), Diagnosis ([-0.05, -0.02], p < .001), and Distribution of a Disease in a Population ([-0.05,-0.01], p = .0016) for the crowdsourced questions and Treatment ([0.03, 0.01], p = .0019), Disease Complications ([0.02, 0.07], p < .001), and Psychosocial ([0.05, 0.1], p < .001) for the clinic questions.

We analyzed the effect of daily and weekly preventive treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) on cell viability, oxidative stress, chromosome, and cytomolecular damage in peripheral blood cultured in vitro. The study protocol included the following: untreated negative control; bleomycin, hydrogen peroxide, or ethanol-treated positive control; daily 0.14mg ferrous sulfate-supplemented group; and weekly 0.55mg ferrous sulfate-supplemented group. We assessed cell viability (methyl-thiazolyl-tetrazolium and neutral red assays), lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay), antioxidant response (superoxide dismutase and catalase enzyme analysis), chromosome damage (cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus cytome assay), and cytomolecular damage (comet assay). Lipid peroxidation, antioxidant response, and chromosome and cytomolecular damage decreased after weekly ferrous sulfate supplementation (p<0.05), suggesting less oxygen free radical production and decreased oxidative stress and genomic damage.

Unlike conventional approaches we use pattern recognition methods, known collectively as machine learning (ML), to examine multivariate data and identify patterns associate with suicidal ideation. Our findings show that accurate prediction of SI of over 84.4% can be obtained with 25 variables, and 81% using as little as 10 variables primarily obtained from the patient health questionnaire (PHQ).

Surface electromyography of eight muscles from arms and legs and the corresponding joint kinematic data were collected while they were crawling on hands and knees at their self-selected velocity. The number of used inter-limb muscle synergies during crawling was identified by nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm. Our results showed that there was no significant difference in the number of used muscle synergies between ARDD and TD infants during crawling. However, a reduced number of synergies were identified in infants with CDD, as compared to that in TD and ARDD infants, indicating constrained neuromuscular control strategy during crawling in developmental delayed infants. The absence of inter-limb muscle synergies may be one of the mechanisms underlying the impairments of crawling in developmental delayed infants, who are at high risk of cerebral palsy.

The foot cannot be safely immobilized due to tilting pressure relief injuries, therefore, the foot can easily fall into a vulnerable position without the user realizing it. To reduce the likelihood of injury, we have developed a sensor for monitoring foot position in real time, as the wheelchair is driven. The sensor uses an array of force-sensing resistors and infrared distance sensors to detect the pressure and location of the foot within the immediate confines of the footplate. Sensor arrays with 23 force sensors and 14 infrared sensors per foot were fabricated on standard printed circuit boards and encapsulated in a durable thermoplastic urethane for environmental resistance. Fabricated sensors transmitted foot pressures and position data at 10 Hz using a Bluetooth Low Energy radio. An iOS app was developed to notify users of vulnerable foot position. Measured results confirmed the functionality of the system over typical foot pressures, and indicated that the device is ready for next-stage clinical trials with spinal cord injured power wheelchair users.'",,,Henzel,M Kristi,MK,,,eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,101243413,1557-170X,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513373

In Japan, approximately 200 instances of wrong-way driving occur annually, and preventative countermeasures, such as road arrows, have been implemented. However, the incidence of wrong-way driving has not decreased since the introduction of these countermeasures, and stronger countermeasures are therefore necessary. More than 70% of wrong-way drivers are elderly individuals, and, in Japan, over 30% of elderly individuals have diseases leading to cognitive decline. In this paper, we focus on the reduction of visual cognitive function due to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and the effects of visual countermeasures on patients with MCI, as determined using a computer graphics movie and an infrared eye tracker to investigate gaze movements. We analyzed differences in fixation points and the quantity of saccades between patients with MCI and healthy individuals.

Study design In this retrospective cohort analysis, the sample was drawn from California singleton livebirths from 2007 to 2012 with linked birth certificate and hospital discharge records. The dataset was divided into a training (2/3 of sample) and a testing (1/3 of sample) set for discovery and validation. Predictive models for preterm birth using pre-pregnancy or first-trimester maternal factors were developed using backward stepwise logistic regression on a training dataset. A risk score for preterm birth was created for each pregnancy using beta-coefficients for each maternal factor remaining in the final multivariable model. Risk score utility was replicated in a testing dataset and by race/ethnicity and payer for prenatal care. Results The sample included 2,339,696 pregnancies divided into training and testing datasets. Twenty-three maternal risk factors were identified including several that were associated with a two or more increased odds of preterm birth (preexisting diabetes, preexisting hypertension, sickle cell anemia, and previous preterm birth). Approximately 40% of women with a risk score  3.0 in the training and testing samples delivered preterm (40.6% and 40.8%, respectively) compared to 3.1-3.3% of women with a risk score of 0.0 [odds ratio (OR) 13.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 10.7-15.8, training; OR 12.2, 95% CI 9.4-15.9, testing). Additionally, over 18% of women with a risk score  3.0 had an adverse outcome other than preterm birth. Conclusion Maternal factors that are identifiable prior to pregnancy or during the first-trimester can be used create a cumulative risk score to identify women at the lowest and highest risk for preterm birth regardless of race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status.

Furthermore, conclusions are limited by small samples and heterogeneity across studies. To examine CI deficits across the schizotypy spectrum using AX-Continuous Performance Task (CPT) and Dot Pattern Expectancy task (DPX) performance. Systematic review involved searching 4 databases and 12 journals, examining key references, and contacting 227 researchers for published and unpublished data. Search terms included AX-CPT/DPX/dot pattern expectancy task/CNTRACs/context* integration/context* processing and schizo*/prodromal/high risk/psychosis; context* and ultra high risk. Independent data from studies with diagnostically or psychometrically assessed schizotypy-spectrum groups and AX-CPT/DPX tasks with 10+ trials and 60+% AX trials were included. Articles were independently coded by two authors using predefined coding schemes with good agreement. Meta-analyses pooled outcomes using random-effects models. Forty-one studies met inclusion criteria. CI impairment was present across the schizotypy spectrum. CI deficits in schizophrenia were substantial and associated with disorganized and negative symptoms. Outcomes were comparable between patients with chronic and first-episode schizophrenia. At-risk groups demonstrated moderate CI impairment. Results were robust across task parameters and there was no evidence that reporting biases grossly impacted outcomes.

Vascular calcification is a risk factor for ischemic vascular disorders and slowing calcification may reduce mortality in affected patients. The absence of early biomarkers hampers the identification of patients at risk. EndMT and vascular calcification are induced upon cooperation between distinct stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-) family members. However, how these signaling pathways interplay to promote cell differentiation and eventually vascular calcification is not well understood. Using in vitro and ex vivo analysis in animal models and patient-derived tissues, we have identified that the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) induce EndMT in human primary aortic endothelial cells, thereby sensitizing them for BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation. Downregulation of the BMP type II receptor BMPR2 is key event in this process. Rather than compromising BMP canonical signal transduction, loss of BMPR2 results in decreased JNK signaling in ECs, thus enhancing BMP-9-induced mineralization. Altogether, our results point at the BMPR-JNK signaling axis as a key pathway regulating inflammation-induced EndMT and contributing to calcification.'",,,Ten Dijke,Peter,P,,"Department of Cell and Chemical Biology, Oncode Institute, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.",eng,,Journal Article,,,England,J Pathol,0204634,0022-3417,,,,6,0,aheadofprint,,10.1002/path.5193

A total of 153 consecutive patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) for de novo AMIs were enrolled in this study. Patients' background data, including PUFA and lipid profiles during PCI, were evaluated retrospectively. The EPA/AA ratio correlated positively with age (r=0.21; P=0.011) and increased markedly from age 60years.

New methods for modelling species distributions include the effects of biotic interactions alongside more commonly used abiotic variables such as temperature and precipitation; however, it is not clear which types of interspecific relationship contribute to shaping species distributions and should therefore be prioritized in models. Even if some interactions are known to be influential at local spatial scales, there is no guarantee they will have similar impacts at macroecological scales. Here we apply a novel method based on information theory to determine which types of interspecific relationship drive species distributions. Our results show that negative biotic interactions such as competition have the greatest effect on model predictions for species from a California grassland community. This knowledge will help focus data collection and improve model predictions for identifying at-risk species. Furthermore, our methodological approach is applicable to any kind of species distribution model that can be specified with and without interspecific relationships.""",,,Pearson,Richard G,RG,,"Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London, London, UK.",eng,,Journal Article,,,England,Biol Lett,101247722,1744-9561,,,,6,0,epublish,,10.1098/rsbl.2018.0426

Long-term disease control on TKI therapy has been the goal and expectation for most patients. More recently, treatment-free remission (TFR) has entered mainstream practice and is increasingly being adopted as the main goal of therapy. This therapeutic shift not only influences TKI selection but also, has necessitated the refinement and dissemination of highly sensitive and accurate molecular monitoring techniques. Measurement of BCR-ABL1 messenger RNA expression through reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, reported according to the International Scale, has become the primary tool for response assessment in CML. Achieving specific time-dependent molecular milestones, as defined by global therapeutic guidelines, has been established as critical in maximizing optimal outcomes while identifying patients at risk of therapy failure. Depth and duration of a deep molecular response have become the new therapeutic targets in patients considered for TFR. Consequently, molecular monitoring in CML has become even more critical to ongoing response assessment, identifying patients with TKI resistance and poor drug adherence, and enabling TFR to be attempted safely and effectively.'",,,Hughes,Timothy P,TP,,"School of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.",eng,,Review,,,United States,Blood,7603509,0006-4971,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.1182/blood-2018-05-848630

This puts patients at risk if they are driving or in a situation where they can fall. ICD's shocks are also very painful and affect a patient's quality of life. It would be ideal if ICDs can accurately predict the occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and then issue a warning or provide preventive therapy. Our study explores the use of ICD data to automatically predict ventricular arrhythmia using heart rate variability (HRV). A 5 minute and a 10 second warning system are both developed and compared. The participants for this study consist of 788 patients who were enrolled in the ICD arm of the Sudden Cardiac Death-Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT). Two groups of patient rhythms, regular heart rhythms and pre-ventricular-tachyarrhythmic rhythms, are analyzed and different HRV features are extracted. Machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM), are trained on these features to classify the two groups of rhythms in a subset of the data comprising the training set. These algorithms are then used to classify rhythms in a separate test set. This performance is quantified by the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve. Both RF and SVM methods achieve a mean AUC of 0.81 for 5-minute prediction and mean AUC of 0.87-0.88 for 10-second prediction; an AUC over 0.8 typically warrants further clinical investigation. Our work shows that moderate classification accuracy can be achieved to predict ventricular tachyarrhythmia with machine learning algorithms using HRV features from ICD data. These results provide a realistic view of the practical challenges facing implementation of machine learning algorithms to predict ventricular tachyarrhythmia using HRV data, motivating continued research on improved algorithms and additional features with higher predictive power.""",,,Brunton,Steven L,SL,,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States of America.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,PLoS One,101285081,1932-6203,,,,6,0,epublish,,PONE-D-18-11553

WHO standardized microneutralization assay was used. Seroprotection rates were 92.9%, 96.2% and 83.4%, for PV1, PV2 and PV3, respectively.

Using the counting process formulation of general nested case-control designs, we propose three sampling schemes where not all commonly observed outcomes need to be included in the analysis. Rather, inclusion probabilities may be time-dependent and may even depend on the past sampling and exposure history.

The nature of the conflict of interest is academic when either the conflict relates to academic duties and/or the nature of the interest is academic. People usually distinguish between real conflict of interest, when private interest overtly influences one's professional obligations; potential conflict of interest, when there is no obvious direct link between a person interests and current duties without ruling out that expected changes in duties cause a situation of conflict; and apparent conflict of interest, when the risk does not really exist, but serious doubts remain. Areas at risk of academic conflict of interest include peer review process for grant evaluation or journals, scientific communications such as elaborating and disseminating clinical guidelines, lecturing at meeting, advising decision-makers, teaching activities, and mentoring. The management of academic conflict of interest should consider actions in four domains, i.e., education, prevention, measures for enforcement and solving, and communication. Academic conflicts of interest are as frequent as financial conflicts but more difficult to identify and assess, and much less addressed in the literature.

Yet, premature infants are also at risk for acute life-threatening complications associated with antibiotic use such as necrotising enterocolitis and for long-term morbidities such as asthma. In this review, we discuss specific aspects of antibiotic use in the very low birthweight preterm infants, with a focus on empiric use, that provide opportunities for stewardship practice. We discuss strategies to risk-stratify antibiotic initiation for the risk of early-onset sepsis, optimise empiric therapy duration and antibiotic choice in late-onset sepsis, and standardise decisions for stopping empiric therapy.

While several studies have begun to understand the functions of WASH in cells lines, the in vivo function of WASH has not been fully elucidated since total body deletion in mice leads to early embryonic lethality. To circumvent this problem, we have used a WASH conditional knockout mouse model to investigate the role of WASH in the pancreas. We find that pancreas-specific deletion of WASH leads to impaired blood glucose clearance and reduced insulin release upon glucose stimulation. Furthermore, WASH depletion results in impaired trafficking of Glut2 in pancreatic beta cells as a consequence of an intracellular accumulation of Glut2 and overall decreased levels of Glut2 protein. Taken together, these results indicate that WASH participates in pancreatic -cell glucose sensing and whole body glucose homeostasis. Thus patients harboring mutations in components of the WASH complex could be at risk for developing type II diabetes.'",,,Billadeau,Daniel D,DD,,"Division of Oncology Research and Schulze Center for Novel Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905 Billadeau.Daniel@mayo.edu.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,Diabetes,0372763,0012-1797,,,,6,0,aheadofprint,,10.2337/db18-0189

It affects many women and is diagnosed based on symptoms and clinical assessment. Because changes occur late in the process, it is useful to have a quantitative assessment that is applied earlier to detect more subtle changes and quantitively assess treatment progress. Our goal was to describe a possible method to accomplish this via measurements of tissue dielectric constant (TDC). TDC was measured at lateral thorax, anterior forearm, and biceps in 120 women awaiting surgery for breast cancer. Inter-side TDC ratios were defined as values measured on the at-risk (cancer-side) lateral thorax divided by TDC values measured on contralateral thorax, forearm, and biceps. These ratios, designated as thorax-thorax, thorax-forearm, and thorax- biceps were (mean  SD) 1.017  0.121, 1.138  0.223, and 1.263  0.255 respectively. Corresponding truncal lymphedema thresholds were determined by adding 2.5SD to each mean yielding thresholds of 1.32, 1.70 and 1.90. For these thresholds, 99.4% of patients would have inter-side ratios less than the threshold value.

Maternal immunisation is a potent tool to protect both of these at-risk groups. Whilst the primary aim of maternal influenza vaccination is to protect the mother, a secondary benefit is the transfer of protective antibodies to the infant. A recent study using the tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine indicated that children born to mothers immunised in the second trimester of pregnancy had the highest antibody titres compared to children immunised in the third trimester. The aim of the current study was to investigate how timing of maternal influenza immunisation impacts infant antibody levels at birth. Antibody titres were assessed in maternal and cord blood samples by both IgG-binding ELISA and haemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI). Antibody titres to the H1N1 component were significantly higher in infants born to mothers vaccinated in either the second or third trimesters than infants born to unvaccinated mothers. HAI levels in the infant were significantly lower when maternal immunisation was performed less than four weeks before birth. These studies confirm that immunisation during pregnancy increases the antibody titre in infants. Importantly antibody levels in cord blood were significantly higher when mother was vaccinated in either trimester two or three, though titres were significantly lower if the mother was immunised less than 4 weeks before birth. Based on this data, seasonal influenza vaccination should continue to be given in pregnancy as soon as it becomes available. This article is protected by copyright.

In this study, underpinned by theoretical models of student commitment, involvement, and engagement, we explored the hypothesis of using inferior participation as an indicator of a higher probability of dropping out in year 1.

BA was also associated with other mood disorders, anxiety disorders and substance use disorder. BD-BA comorbidity was related with more severe course of illness.

Diets that are deficient in zinc lead to impaired immunity and delayed recovery from and worse outcomes following infection. Sustained insufficient zinc intake leads to dysregulation of the innate immune response and increases susceptibility to infection whereas zinc supplementation in at-risk populations has been shown to restore host defense and reduce pathogen-related morbidity and mortality. Upon infection, zinc deficiency leads to increased pathology due to imbalance in key signaling networks that result in excessive inflammation and collateral tissue damage. In particular, zinc impacts macrophage function, a critical front-line cell in host defense, in addition to other immune cells. Deficits in zinc adversely impact macrophage function resulting in dysregulation of phagocytosis, intracellular killing, and cytokine production. An additional work in this field has revealed a vital role for several zinc transporter proteins that are required for proper bioredistribution of zinc within mononuclear cells to achieve an optimal immune response against invading microorganisms. In this review, we will discuss the most recent developments regarding zinc's role in innate immunity and protection against pathogen invasion.""",,,Knoell,Daren L,DL,,"Department of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, 86120 Nebraska Medical Center Omaha, NE 68198-6120, USA.",eng,,Review,,,Egypt,J Immunol Res,101627166,2314-7156,,,,6,0,epublish,,PMC6207864

Diets are the main source of K supply to humans and can contribute to both K deficiency (hypokalemia) and excess (hyperkalemia). While global attention is currently devoted to K deficiency, K excess can be even more dangerous and deserves equal attention. The objectives of this paper were to (i) estimate the K intake of Ghanaian population using food supply and food composition data and (ii) compare this estimate with the WHO-recommended requirement for K in order to assess if there is a risk of inadequate or excess K intake. Food supply data (1961-2011) were obtained from the Food Balance Sheet (FBS) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to derive trends in food and K supply. The average food supply in the FBS for 2010 and 2011 was used in assessing the risk of inadequate or excess dietary intake of K. The K content of the food items was obtained from food composition databases. Based on 2010-2011 average data, the K supply per capita per day was approximately 9,086mg, about 2.6-fold larger than the WHO-recommended level (3,510mg). The assessment suggests a potentially large risk of excess dietary K supply at both individual and population levels. The results suggest the need for assessing options for managing K excess as part of food security and public health strategies. The results further underscore a need for assessment of the K status of staple food crops and mixed diets, as well as K management in food crop production systems in Ghana.'",,,Quansah,Reggie,R,,"Department of Biological, Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences, School of Public Health, College of Health Sciences, University of Ghana, Accra, Ghana.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,J Nutr Metab,101526296,2090-0724,,,,6,1,epublish,,PMC6207884

Inpatient continuation of GDMT for HFrEF appears safe and well-tolerated in most hemodynamically stable patients. Hospitalization is also a potential time for switching from an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker to sacubitril/valsartan therapy in eligible patients, and is the subject of ongoing study. Therapy withdrawal or need for dose reduction is rarely required, but if needed identifies a particularly at-risk group of patients with progressive HF. If recurrent intolerance to neurohormonal blockers is observed, these patients should be evaluated for advanced HF therapies.

In this review, the impacts of environmental exposure to NPs, the influence of the physicochemical characteristics of NPs and the surrounding environment on toxicity and mechanisms of toxicity together with NP bioaccumulation and trophic transfer are assessed with a focus on their impacts on bacteria, algae and daphnids. We identify several gaps which need urgent attention in order to make sound decisions to protect the environment. These include uncertainty in both estimated and measured environmental concentrations of NPs for reliable risk assessment and for regulating the NP industry. In addition toxicity tests and risk assessment methodologies specific to NPs are still at the research and development stage. Also conflicting and inconsistent results on physicochemical characteristics and the fate and transport of NPs in the environment suggest the need for further research. Finally, improved understanding of the mechanisms of NP toxicity is crucial in risk assessment of NPs, since conventional toxicity tests may not reflect the risks associated with NPs. Behavioural effects may be more sensitive and would be efficient in certain situations compared with conventional toxicity tests due to low NP concentrations in field conditions.

Effective transfer and transition programs assure that patients with CHD remain in follow-up and receive continuous holistic care. Unfortunately, adult patients with CHD carry residual lesions and sequelae putting them at risk for premature death related to re-interventions or complications; most commonly heart failure and arrhythmia [2]. The scientific adult CHD (ACHD) community has been working hard to identify variables related to worse outcomes, modifying those where possible in order to improve survival. Indeed, survival in adults with CHD has increased, but consequently, on top of CHD-related complications, patients are increasingly exposed to the standard cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, a program for lifelong coaching on health behavior and life style management becomes indispensable. More emerging is that a substantial number of patients, in particular those with complex heart defects, will eventually end up in a stage with hardly any medical or interventional options left. Our healthcare provision has to be prepared to organize care for this specific group of patients who will die prematurely and require the timely development and establishment of advanced care planning.

Here, we aim to demonstrate the feasibility of developing algorithms for predicting DRE using machine learning methods. Longitudinal, intersected data sourced from US pharmacy, medical, and adjudicated hospital claims from 1,376,756 patients from 2006 to 2015 were analyzed; 292,892 met inclusion criteria for epilepsy, and 38,382 were classified as having DRE using a proxy measure for drug resistance. Patients were characterized using 1270 features reflecting demographics, comorbidities, medications, procedures, epilepsy status, and payer status. Data from 175,735 randomly selected patients were used to train three algorithms and from the remainder to assess the trained models' predictive power. A model with only age and sex was used as a benchmark. The best model, random forest, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% confidence interval [CI]) of 0.764 (0.759, 0.770), compared with 0.657 (0.651, 0.663) for the benchmark model. Moreover, predicted probabilities for DRE were well-calibrated with the observed frequencies in the data. The model predicted drug resistance approximately 2years before patients in the test dataset had failed two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Machine learning models constructed using claims data predicted which patients are likely to fail 3 AEDs and are at risk of developing DRE at the time of the first AED prescription. The use of such models can ensure that patients with predicted DRE receive specialist care with potentially more aggressive therapeutic interventions from diagnosis, to help reduce the serious sequelae of DRE.""",,,Sun,Jimeng,J,,"Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Computing, Atlanta, GA, USA.

However, much of the evidence is based on measures that combine content (i.e., what was said) and the emotion with which it was said, which are then examined using sequential analyses. Despite the general presumptions about underlying emotional reactivity and escalation in negative emotions as part of relationship distress and deterioration, little empirical data are available that directly examine these continuous shifts in emotions. The current study examined concurrent and longitudinal associations between relationship satisfaction and trajectories of change in vocally expressed emotional arousal during couple conflict in 62 couples who participated in a relationship education program. Contrary to expectations and patterns found in distressed couples, trajectories followed a U-shape rather than an inverted U-shape curve, with steeper and more persistent decreases in emotional arousal predicting more stable relationship satisfaction over time. In addition, there were within-couple effects. These results suggest that early signs for relationship deterioration may be less in the form of overt escalation as would be seen in distressed couples. Instead, couples who subsequently deteriorate more are less effective in calming emotional arousal. They also are less able to remain at lower emotional arousal. It is possible that the more pronounced escalation toward the end of the conversation in more at-risk couples is a precursor of the greater escalation patterns seen in distressed couples; this should be examined empirically.

We conducted a blinded case-control study within the HPV FOCAL randomized cervical cancer screening trial of women aged 25-65 to examine whether baseline methylation testing using the S5 classifier provided triage performance similar to an algorithm relying on cytology and HPV genotyping. Groups were randomly selected from 257 women with known HPV/cytology results and pathology outcomes. Group 1: 104 HPV positive (HPV+), abnormal cytology (54 CIN2/3; 50 <CIN2); Group 2: 103 HPV+, normal cytology with HPV persistence at 12 mo. (53 CIN2/3; 50 <CIN2); Group 3: 50 HPV+, normal cytology with HPV clearance at 12 mo. (assumed <CIN2). For the combined groups, S5 risk score CIN2/3 relative sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were compared with other triage approaches. Methylation showed a highly significant increasing trend with disease severity. For CIN3, S5 relative sensitivity and specificity were: 93.2% (95%CI: 81.4-98.0) and 41.8% (35.2-48.8), compared to 86.4% (75.0-95.7) and 49.8% (43.1-56.6) respectively for combined abnormal cytology/HPV16/18 positivity (differences not significant); adjusted PPVs were 18.2% (16.2-20.4) and 19.3% (16.6-22.2) respectively. S5 was also positive in baseline specimens from eight cancers detected during or after trial participation. The S5 methylation score had high sensitivity and PPV for CIN3, compatible with US and European thresholds for colposcopy referral.

Twenty-four OBP, 20 offspring of control parents with non-bipolar psychopathology (OCP), and 27 healthy controls (HC) had acceptable rsFC data. After preprocessing steps, we assessed group differences in seed-based rsFC between the IFG and target clusters (LINS, LENT, MCING) using multivariate regression. Next, we tested whether rsFC correlated with person-level risk score and with other dimensional measures. We did not find group differences in rsFC between IFG and target regions. Within OBP, risk score negatively correlated with IFG-LINS rsFC (p= 0.002). Across groups, mood lability correlated negatively with rsFC between IFG and target regions (p=0.0002), due to negative correlation with IFG-LINS (p=0.0003) and IFG-MCING (p=0.001) rsFC. While group-level differences were not replicated, IFG-LINS rsFC was negatively correlated with a person-level risk score in OBP and with mood lability (a predictor of BD) across the sample. Thus, IFG-LINS rsFC might constitute a risk marker, within OBP, for the development of BD.'",,,Phillips,Mary L,ML,,"University of Pittsburgh, 3811O Hara St, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, USA.",eng,,Journal Article,,,England,Neuropsychopharmacology,8904907,0893-133X,,,,6,0,aheadofprint,,10.1038/s41386-018-0264-9

A vaccine targeting fentanyl could offer protection against fatal overdoses in both recreational drug users and others in professions at risk of accidental exposure. This study focuses on the development of a vaccine consisting of a fentanyl hapten (F) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) carrier protein or to GMP-grade subunit KLH (sKLH). Immunization with F-KLH in mice and rats reduced fentanyl-induced hotplate antinociception and in rats reduced fentanyl distribution to brain compared to controls. F-KLH did not reduce antinociceptive effects of equianalgesic doses of heroin or oxycodone in rats. To assess vaccine effect on fentanyl toxicity, rats immunized with F-sKLH or unconjugated sKLH were exposed to increasing s.c. doses of fentanyl. Vaccination with F-sKLH shifted the dose-response curves to the right for both fentanyl-induced antinociception and respiratory depression. Naloxone reversed fentanyl effects in both groups, showing that its activity for reversing opioid overdose was preserved.

Typically, the optimal patient position is determined based on anatomical landmarks or implanted markers. In the presence of non-rigid anatomical changes, however, the planning scenario cannot be exactly reproduced and positioning should rather aim at finding the optimal position in terms of the actually applied dose. In this work, dose-guided patient alignment, implemented as multicriterial optimization (MCO) problem, was investigated in the scope of intensity-modulated and double-scattered PT (IMPT and DSPT) for the first time. A method for automatically determining the optimal patient position with respect to pre-defined clinical goals was implemented. Linear dose interpolation was used to access a continuous space of potential patient shifts. Fourteen head and neck (H&N) and eight prostate cancer patients with up to five repeated CTs were included. Dose interpolation accuracy was evaluated and the potential dosimetric advantages of dose-guided over bony-anatomy-based patient alignment investigated by comparison of clinically relevant target and organ-at-risk (OAR) dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters. Dose interpolation was found sufficiently accurate with average pass-rates of 90% and 99% for an exemplary H&N and prostate patient, respectively, using a 2% dose-difference criterion. Compared to bony-anatomy-based alignment, the main impact of automated MCO-based dose-guided positioning was a reduced dose to the serial OARs (spinal cord and brain stem) for the H&N cohort. For the prostate cohort, under-dosage of the target structures could be efficiently diminished. Limitations of dose-guided positioning were mainly found in reducing target over-dosage due to weight loss for H&N patients, which might require adaptation of the treatment plan. Since labor-intense online quality-assurance is not required for dose-guided patient positioning, it might, nevertheless, be considered an interesting alternative to full online re-planning for initially mitigating the effects of anatomical changes.'",,,Richter,Christian,C,,"OncoRay - National Center for Radiation Research in Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universität Dresden, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf, Fetscherstr. 74, PF 41, 01307 Dresden, Germany; Department of Radiotherapy and Radiation Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universität Dresden, Fetscherstr. 74, 01307 Dresden, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) partner site Dresden, Germany and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany; Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf, Institute of Radiooncology - OncoRay, Bautzner Landstr. 400, 01328 Dresden, Germany.",eng,,Journal Article,,,Germany,Z Med Phys,100886455,0939-3889,,,,6,0,aheadofprint,,10.1016/j.zemedi.2018.10.003

Existing data suggest that high distress intolerance (DI), an individual difference reflective of the ability to withstand negative affect, is linked to CUD, possibly via stress-elicited impairment of response inhibition but this has never been explicitly tested. Frequent cannabis users with high and low DI completed a go/no-go task during EEG recording before and after a laboratory stressor. Relations between DI, cannabis use-related problems, and behavioral as well as neurophysiological markers of response inhibition functioning were assessed. DI significantly moderated the effect of the stressor on the conflict-monitoring but not evaluative phase of response inhibition as measured by N2 and P3a amplitude, respectively. Unexpectedly, cannabis users with high DI demonstrated stressor-elicited enhancement rather than impairment of conflict-monitoring neural activity, which was related to faster reaction time (RT) and decreased past-month cannabis problems. Enhanced inhibition-related modulation of P3a amplitude was generally associated with increased cannabis problems regardless of acute stress. Results did not provide support for stress-elicited impairment in cognitive control as a mechanism linking high DI and CUD, though some support was found for the relevance of inhibition-related neural activity to CUD. Stress-elicited enhancement of conflict-monitoring neural activity during response inhibition may reflect an adaptive neural response among cannabis users with high DI that protects against CUD in this at-risk group.

It is now clear that the traditional risk factors of cardiovascular disease are driven by primary factors like globalisation, urbanisation, industrialisation and agricultural practices. Pesticide use is an integral component of modern and improved agriculture. The abuse and misuse of these chemicals has caused significant poisoning worldwide and particularly in low- and middle-income countries where Africa belongs. This review surveys the widening population of people poisoned by pesticides in Africa and examines the possibility of pesticide-induced cardiotoxicity. The exposed group includes workers in pesticide industries, transporters of these chemicals, farmers, farm workers who apply these pesticides, vendors and sellers of farm produce and consumers of foodstuffs that are treated with pesticides as well as persons who consume water and inhale air filled with pesticides. There are numerous animal model studies that employ electrocardiography, echocardiography, enzyme studies and histopathology to demonstrate pesticide-induced cardiotoxicity in many parts of the world. There are also case reports and epidemiological data of pesticide-induced cardiovascular intoxication in man. With the increasing reports of pesticide-induced central system nervous toxicity in Africa, there are enough reasons to suspect cardiovascular system poisoning as well. The poorly developed clinical toxicology specialty may explain the low index of suspicion of pesticide-induced cardiovascular diseases. With the pervading ignorance, indiscriminate sale, unguarded use, lack of adequate legislation, inadequate enforcement of legal institutes associated with pesticide use in Africa, there is no doubt that the increasing prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular diseases may partly be due to exposure to these chemicals. Africans may after all be at risk of pesticide-induced cardiotoxicity, but more studies will be required to examine the pattern of cardiotoxicity as well as factors that modulate its occurence.'",,,Anakwue,Raphael,R,,"Department of Medicine, Department of Pharmacology/Therapeutics, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Nigeria, University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, Nigeria. dranakwue@yahoo.com.",eng,,Review,,,United States,Cardiovasc Toxicol,101135818,1530-7905,,,,6,0,aheadofprint,,10.1007/s12012-018-9486-7

We evaluated the role of thrombocytopenia and poor graft function in allogeneic stem cell recipients receiving ICU treatments along with established prognostic ICU markers in order to identify patients at risk for severe complications. At ICU admission, clinical and laboratory data of 108 allogeneic stem cell transplanted ICU patients were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Platelet counts (50,000/l, p<0.0005), hemoglobin levels (8.5mg/dl, p=0.019), and leukocyte count (1500/l, p=0.025) along with sepsis (p=0.002) and acute myeloid leukemia (p<0.0005) correlated significantly with survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed thrombocytopenia (hazard ratio (HR) 2.79 (1.58-4.92, 95% confidence interval (CI)) and anemia (HR 1.82, 1.06-3.11, 95% CI) as independent mortality risk factors. Predominant ICU diagnoses were acute respiratory failure (75%), acute kidney injury (47%), and septic shock (30%). Acute graft versus host disease was diagnosed in 42% of patients, and 47% required vasopressors. Low platelet (50,000/l) and poor graft function are independent prognostic factors for impaired survival in critically ill stem cell transplanted patients. The underlying pathophysiology of poor graft function is not fully understood and currently under investigation. High-risk patients may be identified and ICU treatments stratified according to allogeneic stem cell patients' individual risk profiles.

However, less is known regarding social determinants for SHS exposure, which may differ from those of maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP). To identify social determinants for SHS exposure only, MSDP only, and MSDP and SHS exposure, data were obtained from all pregnant women (18-54years; N=726) in waves 1 and 2 of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health Study (2014-2015). Multiple logistic regressions were conducted using SAS 9.4. Smoke exposure during pregnancy was common; 23.0% reported SHS exposure only, 6.1% reported MSDP only, and 11.8% reported both SHS exposure and MSDP. Results demonstrate that relationships between smoke exposure during pregnancy and social determinants vary by type of exposure. Women at risk for any smoke exposure during pregnancy include those who are unmarried and allow the use of combustible tobacco products within the home. Those who are at higher risk for SHS exposure include those who are younger in age, and those who are earlier in their pregnancy. Those who are at higher risk for maternal smoking include those with fair/poor mental health status and those who believe that others' view tobacco use more positively. These results suggest the need for implementing more comprehensive policies that promote smoke-free environments. Implementing these strategies have the potential to improve maternal and fetal health outcomes associated with tobacco smoke exposure.""",,,Fuemmeler,Bernard F,BF,,"Department of Health Behavior & Policy, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, United States of America.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,Prev Med Rep,101643766,2211-3355,,,,6,1,epublish,,PMC6218644

To prevent CVD, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) imaging, a noninvasive ultrasonography method, has proven to be clinically valuable in identifying at-risk persons before adverse events. Researchers are developing systems to automate CIMT video interpretation based on deep learning, but such efforts are impeded by the lack of large annotated CIMT video datasets. CIMT video annotation is not only tedious, laborious, and time consuming, but also demanding of costly, specialty-oriented knowledge and skills, which are not easily accessible. To dramatically reduce the cost of CIMT video annotation, this paper makes three main contributions. Our first contribution is a new concept, called Annotation Unit (AU), which simplifies the entire CIMT video annotation process down to six simple mouse clicks. Our second contribution is a new algorithm, called AFT (active fine-tuning), which naturally integrates active learning and transfer learning (fine-tuning) into a single framework. AFT starts directly with a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), focuses on selecting the most informative and representative AU s from the unannotated pool for annotation, and then fine-tunes the CNN by incorporating newly annotated AU s in each iteration to enhance the CNN's performance gradually. Our third contribution is a systematic evaluation, which shows that, in comparison with the state-of-the-art method (Tajbakhsh et al., IEEE Trans Med Imaging 35(5):1299-1312, 2016), our method can cut the annotation cost by >81% relative to their training from scratch and >50% relative to their random selection.

Patients and methods In seven patients with lung cancer, proton beam therapy was planned using 4D robust optimization over 4D computed tomography (CT) data sets. The gross target volume (GTV) was contoured based on individual breathing phases, and a 5-mm expansion was used to generate the clinical target volume (CTV) for each phase. The 4D optimization was conducted directly on the 4D CT data set. The robust optimization settings included a CT Hounsfield unit (HU) uncertainty of 4% and a setup uncertainty of 5 mm to obtain the CTV. Additional target dose objectives such as those for the internal target volume (ITV) as well as the organ-at-risk (OAR) dose requirements were placed on the average CT. For comparison, three-dimensional (3D) robust optimization was also performed on the average CT. An additional verification 4D CT was performed to verify plan robustness against inter-fractional variations. Results Target coverages were generally higher for 4D optimized plans. The difference was most pronounced for ITV V70Gy when evaluating individual breathing phases. The 4D optimized plans were shown to be able to maintain the ITV coverage at full prescription, while 3D optimized plans could not. More importantly, this difference in ITV V70Gy between the 4D and 3D optimized plans was also consistently observed when evaluating the verification 4D CT, indicating that the 4D optimized plans were more robust against inter-fractional variations. Less difference was seen between the 4D and 3D optimized plans in the lungs criteria: V5Gy and V20Gy. Conclusion The proton PBS treatment plans optimized directly on the 4D CT were shown to be more robust when compared to those optimized on a regular 3D CT. Robust 4D optimization can improve the target coverage for the proton PBS lung treatments.'",,,Chang,Chang,C,,"Medical Physics, Texas Center for Proton Therapy, Irving, USA.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,Cureus,101596737,2168-8184,,,,6,1,epublish,,PMC6200439

To this end, anti-inflammatory mechanisms of several phytochemicals such as curcumin, resveratrol, propolis, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and ginsenosides have been extensively studied. However, correlation of the phytochemicals with neuroinflammation or brain nutrition is not fully considered, especially in their therapeutic mechanism for neuronal damage or dysfunction. In this article, we review the advance in antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of phytochemicals and discuss the potential communication with brain microenvironment by improved gastrointestinal function, enhanced systemic immunity, and neuroprotective outcomes. These data show that phytochemicals may modulate and suppress neuroinflammation of the brain by several approaches: (1) reducing systemic inflammation and infiltration via the blood-brain barrier (BBB), (2) direct permeation into the brain parenchyma leading to neuroprotection, (3) enhancing integrity of disrupted BBB, and (4) vagal reflex-mediated nutrition and protection by gastrointestinal function signaling to the brain. Therefore, many phytochemicals have multiple potential neuroprotective approaches contributing to therapeutic benefit for pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and development of strategies for preventing these diseases represents a considerable public health concern and socioeconomic burden.""",,,Leng,Sean X,SX,,"Division of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.",eng,,Review,,,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,101479826,1942-0994,,,,6,0,epublish,,PMC6196798

Mounting evidence suggests that adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern may slow cognitive decline, and is important to characterise in at-risk cohorts. Thus, we determined the reliability and validity of the Mediterranean Diet and Culinary Index (MediCul), a new tool, among community-dwelling individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A total of sixty-eight participants (66 % female) aged 759 (sd 66) years, from the Study of Mental and Resistance Training study MCI cohort, completed the fifty-item MediCul at two time points, followed by a 3-d food record (FR). MediCul test-retest reliability was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), Bland-Altman plots and  agreement within seventeen dietary element categories. Validity was assessed against the FR using the Bland-Altman method and nutrient trends across MediCul score tertiles. The mean MediCul score was 546/1000, with few participants reaching thresholds for key Mediterranean foods. MediCul had very good test-retest reliability (ICC=093, 95 % CI 0884, 0954, P<00001) with fair-to-almost-perfect agreement for classifying elements within the same category. Validity was moderate with no systematic bias between methods of measurement, according to the regression coefficient (y=-230+017x) (95 % CI -0027, 0358; P=0091). MediCul over-estimated the mean FR score by 6 %, with limits of agreement being under- and over-estimated by 11 and 23 %, respectively. Nutrient trends were significantly associated with increased MediCul scoring, consistent with a Mediterranean pattern.

Thus, CD5+ B cells are clearly loaded with autoimmune clues that are yet to be unlocked and understood. We hypothesize that human CD5+ B cells are likely to yield enormously important novel information about the role of B cells in autoimmune disease if analyzed using the new technological advances in molecular biology and genomics. Use of high-throughput sequencing of B cell receptors (BCR) of CD5+ B cells could reveal public BCRs associated with autoimmune diseases, whereas transcriptional analysis of CD5+ B cells using single-cell RNA-seq may delineate distinct sublineages and their relationship to conventional B cells.

Social phobia is one such mental disorder that can have significant impact on the livelihood of adults if not detected at an early stage. There have been very few studies done on social phobia among adolescents in South India. Hence, this study was done to determine the prevalence of social phobia and factors associated with it among the school-going adolescents in rural Puducherry. Methodology A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 1018 school going adolescents from December 2017 to January 2018 in rural Puducherry. Information on socio-demographic characteristics was collected by a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire and social phobia was assessed using the validated Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) questionnaire. Results Among 1018 participants, 738 (72.5%) belonged to early adolescence (10-13 years); 520 (51.1%) were boys; 557 (54.7%) were studying in a middle class; 931 (91.5%) were Hindus; 978 (96.1%) had siblings. The prevalence of social phobia among adolescents was found to be 22.9% (95% CI: 20.4-25.5%). The prevalence of mild social phobia was 18% [95% confidence interval (CI): 15.7-20.4%], moderate social phobia was 4% (95% CI: 2.9-5.4%), severe social phobia was 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3-1.3%) and very severe social phobia was 0.2% (95% CI: 0.03-0.64%). Higher age, female gender, lack of counselling services and specialist visits at school were found to be determinants of social phobia. Conclusion The current study showed that one in every five adolescents was at risk of developing social phobia.

We evaluated missed opportunities for HIV screening and linkage to PrEP from 2006 through 2017 at an urban academic medical center serving a predominantly minority community. A missed opportunity for HIV screening was a provider visit that did not include HIV testing and occurred within the 12 months before the first positive HIV test. A missed opportunity for prevention was a visit after 2012 that included a negative HIV test, no evaluation for PrEP, and was followed by a positive HIV test. Univariate analysis was performed to assess characteristics of individuals with missed opportunities for screening and prevention services. Between 2006 and 2017, 721 patients were newly diagnosed with HIV. Two hundred forty-seven diagnoses were made in the early period (2006-2010), 236 in the middle period (2010-2013), and 238 in the late period (2014-2017).

Both organisations promote the role of evidence-based foot care for patients with and at risk of diabetes. This collaborative work highlights the podiatric skills needed in order to deliver comprehensive evidence-based care to patients with diabetic foot disease. The statements along with the relevant skills and behaviours are based upon the guidance documents produced by the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF), thus meaning while this is a consensus document it is also evidence-based. Representatives from both organisations with a multidisciplinary membership met early in 2017 to discuss the different areas of practice and to define which skills and behaviours were required at different levels of practice. Using the TRIEpodD-document (UK) and IWGDF guidance as the basis for discussion, the team identified which knowledge, skills and behaviours could be considered podiatric in nature. Once identified as podiatric, we discussed at which level of podiatric practice they could apply. The members of the team came from a variety of locations which represented practice at the different levels. Following the initial meeting, further discussions took place via email in order to consolidate initial discussions and complete the document. Cognisant of the large volume of guidance in relation to all areas of practice, this document is aimed to assist clinicians by pointing them in the direction in which they need to develop services rather than being a set of rules which must be followed. The POINT team feels that this document supports clinicians globally on three levels: As a benchmarking tool for existing teams to critically reflect upon their practice and identify where quality improvements can be made As a tool for clinicians who wish to establish a diabetic foot team to highlight the skills needed in order to provide care across the breadth of diabetic foot practice highlighting the specific roles in which podiatrists can help For national and local decision makers, to identify which skills can be provided by podiatrists to promote the development of the profession. While this is a consensus relating to podiatric skills, the team is aware that, in the absence of podiatrists, skills will be provided by other health professionals. We support this practice and while such professionals can not be considered podiatrists, they are providing podiatric skills to the diabetic foot team. The delivery of the relevant skill to the patient is the important factor, not the health professional is delivering it. The development of this document is merely the first step to identifying areas where skills need to be developed. Both D-Foot and FIP-IFP are committed to developing podiatric skills further across the globe. The aims and objectives of the two organisations are mutually beneficial to those suffering from diabetic foot disease. People with diabetes deserve the best care that they can receive, irrespective of the resources available. By working together we have been able to identify the podiatric knowledge, skills and behaviours required to provide evidence-based care.

We utilized functional connectivity (FC) from ten-minute non-invasive resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to identify stroke subjects at risk for subclinical language deficit (SLD) using a machine learning classifier. Discriminative ability of FC derived from slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz), slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) and low frequency oscillations (LFO; 0.01-0.1 Hz) were compared. Sixty clinically non-aphasic right-handed subjects were categorized into three groups based on stroke status and normalized verbal fluency score (VFS): 20 ischemic stroke subjects at a higher risk of SLD (LD+; mean VFS=-1.77), 20 ischemic stroke subjects with lower risk of SLD (LD-; mean VFS=-0.05), 20 healthy controls (HC; mean VFS=0.29). T1-weighted and rs-fMRI scans were acquired within 30 days of stroke onset. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal was extracted from regions in the language network and FC based on Pearson's correlation was evaluated. Selected features were used by a multiclass support vector machine to classify test subject into one of the subgroups. Classifier performance was assessed using a nested leave-one-out cross-validation. FC derived from slow-4 (70%) band provided the best accuracy in comparison to LFO (65%) and slow-5 (50%) , reasonably higher than random chance (33.33%). Based on subgroup-specific accuracy, classification was best realized within the slow-4 band for LD+ (81.6%) and LD- (78.3%) and slow-4 and LFO bands for HC (80%), i.e., early stage stroke subjects showed a slow-4 FC dominance whereas HC also indicated the normalized involvement of FC in LFO. While frontal FC differentiated between stroke and healthy, occipital FC differentiated between the two stroke groups. We demonstrated that stroke subjects at risk for SLD can be differentiated from control subjects using rs-fMRI with a classifier with reasonable accuracy in an expedited manner, which otherwise could take longer to identify via neuropsychological assessments.""",,,Prabhakaran,Vivek,V,,"University of Wisconsin, Radiology , 600 Highland Avenue , madison, Wisconsin, United States , 53792-3252 ; vprabhakaran@uwhealth.org.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,Brain Connect,101550313,2158-0014,,,,6,0,aheadofprint,,10.1089/brain.2018.0597

Evidenced-based data exists on the feasibility, implementation, and efficacy of stepped care models in primary care settings for the management of CP and opioid use. Although these studies did not enroll participants with OUD, they included a sub-set of patients at risk for the development of OUD. There remains a dearth of treatment options for those with comorbid CP and OUD. Future research is needed to explore the aetiology and impact of CP and OUD, and greater emphasis is needed to improve access to comprehensive pain and substance use programmes for high-risk individuals.'",,,Antoine,Denis,D,,"a Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences , Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore , MD , USA.",eng,,Journal Article,,,England,Int Rev Psychiatry,8918131,0954-0261,,,,6,0,aheadofprint,,10.1080/09540261.2018.1514369

Our aim was to improve appropriate oxygen delivery to 90% of our patients on a 30-bedded respiratory ward within 3 months. We identified several key steps to safe oxygen delivery on our ward. These include the recording of target oxygen saturation range, the prescribing of an oxygen order on drug chart and the correct bedside delivery of oxygen to the patient. To help improve compliance of these key steps, the following plan-do-study-act (PDSA) interventions were undertaken: (1) Educational announcements at board rounds. (2) A communication oxygen poster. (3) Highlighting improvement progress to teams via email. (4) Pharmacist review of inpatient drug chart. (5) Display of target oxygen saturation range at patient bedside. At baseline, only 50% of drug charts had a recorded oxygen order and 60% of drug charts had a set target oxygen saturation range. Following PDSA interventions, both measures improved to 93%. Our main outcome measure of appropriate oxygen delivery to the patient improved from a baseline of 20% to 80% on completion. Our quality improvement programme has shown simple interventions can improve oxygen prescribing and appropriate delivery of oxygen to the patient.

CASE REPORT A 75-year-old male with a history of postoperative cognitive complications including delirium and mild cognitive impairment. He was attending an outpatient preoperative anesthesia clearance assessment prior to a planned removal for a left frontoethmoidal sinus mucocele. As part of clinical care, an in-house neuropsychologist completed a neurobehavioral exam to assess current cognitive status and guide perioperative cognitive care recommendations. Findings were consistent with mild neurocognitive disorder. CONCLUSIONS Given the patient's history and current status, he was listed as a high delirium risk. The team provided information on delirium and delirium risk factors, encouraged the patient to speak to his surgeon and also a geriatric specialist to assist with decision making. Due to their concern about delirium, the patient and his caregiver opted to postpone the left frontoethmoidal sinus mucocele removal.""",,,Price,Catherine E,CE,,"Department of Anesthesiology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL, USA.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,Am J Case Rep,101489566,1941-5923,,,,6,0,epublish,,10.12659/AJCR.911437

Participants included adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors (N = 70) of non-central nervous system cancer, aged 14-21 presenting for LTFU. Patient-reported data were obtained on survivors' EF, internalizing symptoms, academic performance, and educational supports. Children's Oncology Group's LTFU Guidelines classified survivors as at risk or not at risk for neurocognitive deficits based on treatment exposures. Group differences, relationships, and moderation by risk group were examined. No differences were found in EF, internalizing symptoms, academic performance, or educational supports between survivors who were at risk versus those not at risk for neurocognitive deficits. Problems with EF predicted internalizing symptoms, an effect that was moderated by risk group (R2= .64 for AYA self-report; R2 = .38 for parent-proxy report). Survivors with poorer EF experienced higher levels of internalizing symptoms. These data indicate that current screening practices may not identify survivors who are not at risk for neurocognitive deficits, yet struggle with EF.

The goal of this article is to highlight the strengths, limitations, and applications of the method used. Fifteen participants completed two intervention blocks with a wash-out period in between the blocks. Each block consisted of twice a week (four weeks) WBV interventions, progressing from 10 to 20 min per session. Low intensity (peak to peak displacement 4.53 mm, frequency 24 Hz, g force 2.21) and higher intensity (peak to peak displacement 8.82 mm, frequency 35 Hz, g force 2.76) WBV blocks were used. Pain severity significantly improved in both groups following higher intensity vibration. Walking speed significantly improved in the group who participated in higher intensity intervention first. No study-related adverse events occurred. Even though this population can be at risk of developing overuse-related muscle weakness, fatigue, or pain from excessive physical activity or exercise, the vibration intensity levels utilized did not cause significant muscle weakness, pain, fatigue, or sleep disturbances. Therefore, WBV appears to provide a safe method of weight bearing exercise for this population. Limitations included the lack of measurement of reflexes, muscular activity, or circulation, the difficulty in participant recruitment, and insufficient strength of some participants to stand in recommended position. Strengths included a standard, safe protocol with intentional monitoring of symptoms and the heterogeneity of the participants in their physical abilities. An application of the methods is the home use of WBV to reduce the barriers associated with going to a facility for weight bearing exercise for longer term interventions, and benefits for conditions such as osteoporosis, particularly for aging adults with mobility difficulties due to paralysis or weakness.

From large patient and population cohorts of asymptomatic women, detection of any coronary artery calcium that identifies females with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk of >7.5% may more effectively triage women who may benefit from pharmacologic therapy. In addition to accurate detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), CT angiography (CTA) identifies nonobstructive atherosclerotic plaque extent and composition which is otherwise not detected by alternative stress testing modalities. Moreover, CTA has superior risk stratification when compared to stress testing in symptomatic women with stable chest pain (or equivalent) symptoms. For the evaluation of symptomatic women both in the emergency department and the outpatient setting, there is abundant evidence from large observational registries and multi-center randomized trials, that CT imaging is an effective procedure. Although radiation doses are far less for CT when compared to nuclear imaging, radiation dose reduction strategies should be applied in all women undergoing CT imaging.

There is neither a universally accepted definition of picky eating, nor is there agreement on the best tool to identify it. Causes of picky eating include early feeding difficulties, late introduction of lumpy foods at weaning, pressure to eat and early choosiness, especially if the mother is worried by this; protective factors include the provision of fresh foods and eating the same meal as the child. The consequences for the child's diet include poor dietary variety and a possible distortion of nutrient intakes, with low intakes of iron and zinc (associated with low intakes of meat, and fruit and vegetables) being of particular concern. Low intakes of dietary fibre, as a result of low intakes of fruit and vegetables, are associated with constipation in picky eaters. There may be developmental difficulties in some children with persistent picky eating. There is little evidence, however, for a consistent effect of being a picky eater on growth trajectories. There may be a small subgroup of children in whom picky eating does not resolve who might be at risk of thinness during adolescence, or of developing an eating disorder or adult picky eating: these children need to be identified at an early age to enable support, monitoring and advice to be offered to parents.

Altogether, 2049-2364 mothers from the Prediction and Prevention of Pre-eclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction (PREDO) study completed the Neonatal Perception Inventory on regulatory behavior problems at the infant's age of 15.6days (SD 3.2, range 1-30), the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised on temperament at 6.5months (SD 0.9, range 4.2-12.4), and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 on developmental milestones and the Child Behavior Checklist on behavioral problems at 3.5years (SD 0.7, range 1.9-6.0). Maternal depressive symptoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (infancy follow-ups) and Beck Depression Inventory-II (childhood follow-up). Father-rated infant temperament and paternal depressive symptoms were also available (n=1474). Higher levels of infant regulatory behavior problems predicted higher levels of mother- and father-rated negative affectivity temperament (0.13 SD units per SD unit, 95% confidence interval 0.09-0.17; and 0.09, 0.04-0.14, respectively), lower levels of mother-rated orienting/regulation temperament (-0.09, -0.13 to -0.05) and problem-solving skills (-0.12, -0.21 to -0.04), and higher levels of Externalizing (0.07, 0.03-0.11) and Total behavioral problems (0.07, 0.03-0.11). Regulatory behaviors partially mediated the effect of maternal depressive symptoms.

The group at highest risk consists of HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected immunosuppressed individuals. In these patients, P. jirovecii infection may lead to Pneumocystis pneumonia; it may, however, persist also in an asymptomatic form. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of P. jirovecii and potential risk factors for infection in a group of renal transplant recipients and to characterize the genetic diversity of this fungus in the studied population. Sputum specimens from 72 patients were tested for presence of P. jirovecii using immunofluorescence microscopy, as well as nested PCR targeting the mtLSU rRNA gene. Genotyping involving analysis of four loci-mtLSU rRNA, CYB, DHPS, and SOD-was used to characterize the diversity of the detected organisms. Pneumocystis DNA was detected in eight (11.11%) patients. It has been shown that low eosinophil count and dual immunosuppressive treatment combining prednisone and calcineurin inhibitors are potential risk factors for colonization. Analysis of genotype distribution showed an association of the wild-type genotype of mtLSU rRNA with lower average age of patients and shorter time after kidney transplantation. Furthermore, CYB 2 genotype was detected only in patients with the ongoing prophylaxis regimen. In conclusion, renal transplant recipients are at risk of Pneumocystis colonization even a long time after transplantation.

Ten breast radiotherapy patients with axillary lymph node inclusion were retrospectively planned with volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy technique. The plans were optimized with the planning target volume (PTV) extending outside the skin contour by 0, 5, 7, and 10 mm; and with optimization boluses of 3 or 5 mm on the extended PTV. The final dose was calculated without the bolus. The plans were compared in terms of PTV homogeneity and conformity, and dose minima and maxima. The doses to organs at risk were also evaluated. The doses were recalculated in real patient geometries based on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images captured 3 to 6 times during each patient's treatment course. The optimization to the PTV without the PTV extension resulted in the best CTV coverage in the original plans (V95%=98.0%  1.2%). However, when these plans were studied in real CBCT-based patient geometries, the CTV V95% was compromised (94.6%  8.3%). In addition, for the surface (4 mm slap inside the PTV 4 mm below the body contour) dose V95% was reduced from the planned 74.7%  7.5% to the recalculated 65.5%  11.5%. Optimization with an 8-mm bolus to a PTV with 5-mm extension was the most robust choice to ensure the CTV and surface dose coverage (recalculated V95% was 95.2%  6.4% and 74.6%  8.4%, respectively). In cases with the largest observed deformations, even a 10-mm PTV extension did not suffice to cover the target. Optimization with a 5-mm PTV extension and an 8-mm optimization bolus improved the surface dose and slightly improved the CTV dose when compared to no extension plans.

The livestock transport is a vital component of today's world agrifood economy that directly impacts on the development of animal production, animal welfare, public policies, labor regulations, food safety, markets and consumers. In this study two aims were established; the first aim was to identify the attitudes and perceptions of commercial hauliers towards animal welfare and their influence on the accident risks. The second aim was to characterize the current practices of the commercial cattle transport in Mexico and to detect the risk factors for animal welfare and hauliers' wellbeing. The interviews were conducted individually at the hauliers' rest points, sanitary inspection points localized along the Federal Highway 57 or at the companies' offices of cattle transportation. We used univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistics based on a hierarchical cluster analysis. The results showed that cattle transport in Mexico is characterized for long travel distances because the cattle departed from farms in the southern states of Mexico to the feedlots located in central and northern regions of the country. The journeys of short and middle distances departed from the feedlots to the slaughterhouses. The hauliers' characteristics were: age from 29 to 48 years-old, elementary or secondary studies completed, 65% of hauliers mentioned six years of experience in cattle transport, they learned about cattle transportation by means of a family member who was already engaged in this activity. The cluster analysis identified four hauliers' groups: groups 1 and 3 were related to animal welfare and groups 2 and 4 less related to animal welfare. This study showed that empathy towards cattle was a key element in identifying hauliers at risk of road accidents during cattle transportation. Years of experience in cattle transport played an important role in emphasizing closer perceptions towards welfare. Considering current trends towards increased transport times and logistics stops, there is a need to develop systems of welfare assessment and decision-making that provide tools and protocols that can minimize the biological cost to animals and hauliers, which may have been underestimated in the past.""",,,Miranda-de la Lama,G C,GC,,"Department of Food Science, Metropolitan Autonomous University (UAM-Lerma), Lerma de Villada, State of México, Mexico; Aragonese Agency for Research and Development (ARAID), Agrifood Institute of Aragon (IA2), Department of Animal Production and Food Science, Faculty of Veterinary, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of introduction of JEV in the US via infected mosquitoes transported in aircraft and cargo ships arriving from Asia, using a QRA model. We created a stochastic model to quantify the probability of introduction of at least one infected mosquito in the continental US via aircraft and cargo ships, per at-risk period (March to October) or year, respectively. We modeled the following parameters: number of flights (per at-risk period, i.e., March to October) and cargo ships (per year) and per region, number of mosquitoes per flight and ship, number of mosquitoes that were not found and sensitivity of the mosquito collection method in aircraft, mosquito infection rates, and number of mosquitoes coming in aircraft per at-risk period (March to October) and cargo ships per year. Flight and cargo ship data pertained to years 2010-2016. For model building purposes, we only considered port-to-port vessels arriving from Asia to the US, we assumed that mosquitoes survive the trans-Pacific Ocean ship crossing and that the number of mosquitoes in cargo and passenger flights is similar. Our model predicted a very high risk (0.95 median probability; 95% CI=0.80-0.99) of at least one infected mosquito being introduced in the US during the at-risk period, i.e., March to October, via aircraft transportation from JEV-affected countries in Asia. We also estimated that a median of three infected mosquitoes can enter the US during the at-risk period, i.e., March to October (95% CI=1-7). The highest probability of introduction via aircraft was attributed to the Mediterranean California ecoregion (0.74; 95% CI=0.50-0.90). We predicted, however, a negligible risk (0; 95% CI=0.00-0.01) of at least one infected mosquito being introduced via cargo ships. Although the risk of introduction of JEV-infected mosquitoes by cargo ships was negligible, the risk via aircraft was estimated to be high.

Traditionally, TcMEPs are obtained by anodal stimulation of the scalp over the motor cortex of the selected hemisphere and referenced to the contralateral hemisphere. Subsequent compound motor action potential responses (CMAPs) are recorded at various muscles. The muscle responses of interest are usually those recorded in the limb contralateral to the hemisphere of stimulation. However, TcMEPs may elicit simultaneous muscle responses in the limbs ipsilateral to the hemisphere of stimulation, otherwise defined as ""crossover"" responses. Crossover TcMEPs are thought to be generated when electrical stimulation reaches the corticospinal tract at intracranial structures as deep as the medullary pyramids. If electrical stimulation penetrates deeper than the at-risk structures, false negatives motor evoked potential monitoring may occur. Therefore, in surgeries where cerebral cortical structures may be at risk, TcMEPs may be elicited so that contralateral CMAP responses are present without crossover responses. We present three cases using an alternative TcMEP montage in which anodal stimulation of the target hemisphere is referenced to Fpz at midline. Compared with the C3-C4/C4-C3 montage, crossover responses are minimized with the modified montage.

This line of reasoning is based on the assumption that children make use of mental visualization processes when working on tasks assessing early mathematical skills, such as knowledge of the sequence of number words, even when these tasks do not involve visual stimulation. We assessed 4- to 6-year-old children's performance in a nonsymbolic numerical magnitude comparison task, in tasks concerning knowledge of the sequence of number words, and in a developmental test to assess visual-spatial skills. Children's nonsymbolic numerical magnitude processing skills were found to be associated with their number word sequence skills.

The radiosensitizing effect of hyperthermia was quantified using biological modelling with a temperaturedependent change in the parameters of the linearquadratic model. The possible effectiveness of reirradiation plus hyperthermia was estimated by calculating the equivalent radiotherapy dose distribution. Treatment planning revealed that tumors located in the pelvis and the extremities can be effectively heated in children. Equivalent dose distributions indicated that hyperthermic radiosensitization can be quantified as a targetselective additional D95% of typically 10Gy, thereby delivering a possibly curative dose of 54Gy, without substantially increasing the equivalent dose to the organs at risk.

The primary outcome is laboratory-confirmed influenza. Each study subject is taken to be at risk of experiencing the outcome from the onset of the influenza season until the first of the following three events occurs: outcome, loss to follow up or end of season. Seasonal influenza vaccination is viewed as time-dependent exposure. Accordingly, each subject may contribute unvaccinated and vaccinated person-time during their time at risk. The vaccine effectiveness is estimated as one minus the influenza incidence rate ratio comparing the vaccinated with the unvaccinated within the study cohorts. Data collection in register-based research is an almost fully automated process.

This advantage is pivotal when vaccine effectiveness estimates are needed in real time. The paper outlines possible limitations of register-based cohort studies.

Others argued that the risk was not critically imminent and an immediate report could seriously compromise maternal confidentiality, risked maternal disengagement and a worse outcome. An alternative was to make more vigorous efforts to contact the mothers and report only if these failed. In the TB case, reporting to child protection was deferred in favour of making more strenuous efforts at communication, which proved successful. In the HIV case, a case worker reported the case to child protection, but when the doctor contacted child protection authorities they agreed not to contact the mother unless the doctor's vigorous attempts to communicate with her failed.

Therefore, recreational fishing is expected to induce both ecological and rapid evolutionary changes in fish populations and consequently requires rigorous management. However, little is known about the coupled demographic and evolutionary consequences of alternative harvest regulations in managed freshwater fisheries. We used a structurally realistic individual-based model and implemented an eco-genetic approach that accounts for microevolution, phenotypic plasticity, adaptive behavior, density-dependent processes, and cryptic mortality sources (illegal harvest and hooking mortality after catch and release). We explored the consequences of a range of harvest regulations, involving different combinations of exploitation intensity and minimum and maximum-length limits, on the eco-evolutionary trajectories of a freshwater fish stock. Our 100-year simulations of size-selective harvest through recreational fishing produced negative demographic and structural changes in the simulated population, but also plastic and evolutionary responses that compensated for such changes and prevented population collapse even under intense fishing pressure and liberal harvest regulations. Fishing-induced demographic and evolutionary changes were driven by the harvest regime, and the strength of responses increased with increasing exploitation intensity and decreasing restriction in length limits. Cryptic mortality strongly amplified the impacts of harvest and might be exerting a selective pressure that opposes that of size-selective harvest. ""Slot"" limits on harvestable length had overall positive effects but lower than expected ability to buffer harvest impacts. Harvest regulations strongly shape the eco-evolutionary dynamics of exploited fish stocks and thus should be considered in setting management policies. Our findings suggest that plastic and evolutionary responses buffer the demographic impacts of fishing, but intense fishing pressure and liberal harvest regulations may lead to an unstructured, juvenescent population that would put the sustainability of the stock at risk.

The cytokine IL17A has been associated with airway inflammation in severe asthma, and novel therapeutic targets within this pathway are urgently needed. We recently showed that IL17A increases airway contractility by activating the procontractile GTPase RhoA. Here, we explore the therapeutic potential of targeting the RhoA pathway activated by IL17A by inhibiting RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs), intracellular activators of RhoA. We first used a ribosomal pulldown approach to profile mouse airway smooth muscle by qPCR and identified Arhgef12 as highly expressed among a panel of RhoGEFs. ARHGEF12 was also the most highly expressed RhoGEF in patients with asthma, as found by RNA sequencing. Tracheal rings from Arhgef12-KO mice and WT rings treated with a RhoGEF inhibitor had evidence of decreased contractility and RhoA activation in response to IL17A treatment. In a house dust mite model of allergic sensitization, Arhgef12-KO mice had decreased airway hyperresponsiveness without effects on airway inflammation. Taken together, our results show that Arhgef12 is necessary for IL17A-induced airway contractility and identify a therapeutic target for severe asthma.'",,,Bhattacharya,Mallar,M,,"Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy, and Sleep, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,JCI Insight,101676073,2379-3708,,,,6,0,aheadofprint,,10.1172/jci.insight.123578

In patients with ependymoma, conventionally fractionated re-irradiation (1.8 Gy/day) can provide long-term disease control with low rates of high-grade toxicity. For children with progressive diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, re-irradiation provides effective palliation of symptoms and a survival gain as compared with those treated without re-irradiation.

Recent publications shed light on the critical contributions of maternal placental pathology and compromised intrauterine growth to fetal pulmonary vascular development. A body of literature has further clarified postnatal risk factors for PH, most notably the severity of BPD but surprisingly the additional presence of non-pulmonary morbidities including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Limitations of current diagnostics persist with growing consideration of novel echocardiographic approaches as well as complementary non-invasive biomarkers to better identify infants at risk. In 2015, a joint report published by the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society provided the first guidelines for the care of children with PH with limited content to address BPD-associated PH. These guidelines were expanded upon in an expert consensus report produced by the Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHNet). These recommendations encouraged the use of standardized screening protocols and emphasized the importance of evaluation and treatment of comorbidities when PH is identified.

In F1, sGC increased the HPA stress response in females, but decreased responsiveness in males (P<0.05). sGC exposure (F0) produced the opposite effects in F2 (P<0.05). Reduced HPA responsiveness in F2 females was associated with reduced expression of proopiomelanocortin mRNA and increased expression of glucocorticoid receptor in the anterior pituitary (P<0.05). Locomotor activity and prepulse inhibition were reduced by sGC in adult F1 offspring. No behavioural changes were observed in F2 animals.

Advances in personal genomics are increasing the public uptake of genetic susceptibility testing for complex diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). For LOAD, the discovery of the major risk 4 allele of the APOE gene has prompted a debate on the ethics and utility of presymptomatic (i.e., predictive) testing. Although the mechanistic contribution of APOE to disease onset remains uncertain, presymptomatic genetic testing provides a relative risk of developing LOAD. Presymptomatic testing for complex disorders, such as LOAD is much less conclusive than early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) which follows a Mendelian inheritance pattern. Given the lack of preventive strategies available for EOAD or LOAD, APOE genotyping offers limited clinical utility, thus, raising ethical and practical questions. We conducted a systematic search of five electronic databases or primary studies published during January 2008-January 2018 which investigated practical and ethical issues of presymptomatic APOE genotyping for LOAD risk estimation. We identified 31 articles which suggested that APOE genotyping for LOAD susceptibility provides potential benefits to at-risk patients and can guide changes in positive health-related behaviors. However, other individuals may experience test-related anxiety, depression and psychological distress. Future research should focus on developing an integrated risk assessment tool to enhance the utility of APOE genotyping.

Later, based on twin studies, Sorsby argued that refraction was almost totally genetically determined. This became the dominant view. However, rapid increases in the prevalence of myopia were then reported, especially in East and Southeast Asia, where the prevalence of myopia in children completing secondary school is now 80-90per cent, with around 20per cent highly myopic, and at risk of ocular pathology. It is not possible to explain these rapid changes genetically, since gene pools cannot change that fast. Nevertheless, there are at least 200 genetic forms of myopia, but these account for myopia in only a low percentage of the population. Genome-wide association studies have identified over 150 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with myopia, but they account for <10per cent of the variation in refraction. In contrast, twin studies have given consistently high heritability estimates for myopia. The high twin study heritability may be explained by the limited environmental variation within twin pairs, combined with basic assumptions made in twin studies. The SNP-heritability approach suggests that 25-35per cent of the variation may be accounted for by hundreds or even thousands of SNPs. The apparent conflicts in the literature can be explained by the aetiological heterogeneity of myopia, and the fact that estimates of heritability are population-specific. It has been proposed that environmental variation is more relevant to variations between populations; however, the current differences between populations are due to changes within populations, driven by educational pressures, and limited time spent outdoors. Ethnic differences in myopia and the effects of parental myopia now seem more likely to be explained by environmental influences. Genetic studies have not yet defined molecular pathways and preventive interventions, and the predictive power of current genetic data is limited.'",,,Rose,Kathryn A,KA,,"Discipline of Orthoptics, Graduate School of Health, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, New South Wales, Australia.",eng,,Review,,,Australia,Clin Exp Optom,8703442,0816-4622,,,,6,0,aheadofprint,,10.1111/cxo.12845

Inadequate micronutrient status may also drive or exacerbate CVD risk factors that emerge during childhood. This study aimed to understand relationships between serum lipid levels, the plasma metabolome, and micronutrient status in 38 children (10  0.8 years) at risk for CVD. Serum lipid levels were measured via autoanalyzer and average daily micronutrient intakes were calculated from 3-day food logs. Plasma metabolites were extracted using 80% methanol and analyzed via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Spearman's rank-order coefficients (rs) were computed for correlations between the following serum lipids [total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG)], 805 plasma metabolites, and 17 essential micronutrients. Serum lipid levels in the children ranged from 128-255 mg/dL for total cholesterol, 67-198 mg/dL for LDL, 31-58 mg/dL for HDL, and 46-197 mg/dL for TG. The majority of children (71 to 100%) had levels lower than the Recommended Daily Allowance for vitamin E, calcium, magnesium, folate, vitamin D, and potassium. For sodium, 76% of children had levels above the Upper Limit of intake. Approximately 30% of the plasma metabolome (235 metabolites) were significantly correlated with serum lipids. As expected, plasma cholesterol was positively correlated with serum total cholesterol (rs = 0.6654; p<0.0001). Additionally, 27 plasma metabolites were strongly correlated with serum TG (rs 0.60; p0.0001), including alanine and diacylglycerols, which have previously been associated with cardiometabolic and atherosclerotic risk in adults and experimental animals.

Artificial roost structures are increasingly being used in conservation efforts for at-risk bat species. To evaluate microhabitat differences in common artificial roost structures and determine if roost selection occurs based on structure type, we installed artificial roosts of three different styles (bat box, rocket box, and bark mimic) in six clusters. We compared size and measured temperature parameters (12 points/roost) while bats were excluded from one cluster. We simultaneously conducted census counts during the active season at five more clusters open to bats for 1-2 years. The rocket box style provided larger entrance area, surface area, and volume versus other roost types. Microclimate varied with roost design. More positions inside the bat box and rocket box stayed within critical temperature limits for bats (0-45C)-i.e., were usable. The bark-mimic provided less usable space than the rocket box and, often, large proportions of the roost were > 45C. The rocket box provided the widest temperature availability in a given hour (max range available 7C) and was more stable than the bark mimic. A maternity colony of Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis) selected the rocket box style; four of five available rocket boxes became primary maternity roosts, with 2-210 bats emerging per night. Future work should aim to manipulate roost size, temperature availability, and temperature stability in isolation to identify which features drive roost microhabitat selection by bats. Comparative studies of artificial roosts account for some inherent irregularity in natural systems, allowing us to study the dynamics of roost microhabitats.

Adolescents constitute 18% of the world's total population and are at risk of becoming physically inactive in the future. Thus, this study aims to find the level of physical activity (PA) among late adolescents and factors that motivate and prevent them from being active. Methodology Four hundred and fifty adolescents in the age group of 18-19 years were included in the study. Standardized self-administered questionnaires such as the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire were used to assess the level of PA and level of motivation, respectively. In addition, barriers to participating in PA were also elicited. Results This study found that about one third of the subjects (32.4%) were physically inactive. The motivation levels were more pooled towards the self-determined motives and girls are more motivated towards PA than boys. However, PA among males is significantly higher than females. Healthy practices in families was also found to have significant association with increased PA. The major barriers found were the excessive use of electronic gadgets and lethargy. Conclusion One third of the adolescents in this study were physically inactive and several barriers that prevent them from taking up PA were elicited. Therefore, efforts should be taken to emphasize the importance of physical activity among individuals, family members and the peers at institutional level and community level so as to lay foundations for healthy lifestyles in the future.

While surgical and pharmacological interventions are commonly used to treat patients with IHD, their efficacy varies from patient to patient and is limited by the severity of the disease. One promising approach for treating IHD is induction of coronary collateral growth (CCG). Coronary collaterals are arteriole-to-arteriole anastomoses that can undergo expansion and remodeling during the occlusion of coronary arteries. The coronary collaterals can restore blood flow in the ischemic area of the myocardium and protect the myocardium at risk. It has been reported that well-developed collaterals are correlated to reduced mortality, infarct size and better cardiac function during occlusion of coronary arteries. Therefore, understanding the process of CCG is highly important for the treatment of IHD. While there are several excellent review articles on this topic, this review will provide a unified overview of the various aspects related to CCG as well as an update of the advancements in the field. We also call for more detailed studies with an interdisciplinary approach to advance our knowledge of CCG.

How NPS mechanistically link to the development of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not fully understood, with potential mechanisms including shared risk factors related to both NPS and cognitive impairment, or AD pathology promoting NPS. This is the first exploratory study to examine whether AD genetic loci as a genetic risk score (GRS), or individually, are a shared risk factor with MBI.

The transmission patterns of this skin infection are poorly defined, hence the current study aimed to contribute to the understanding, perceptions and interpretations of its mode of transmission using a socio-environmental approach. Social and environmental risk factors that may expose people to infection, and the dynamics of local transfer of knowledge and practices related to BU, were assessed in two endemic locations in southern Cte d'Ivoire, i.e. Taabo and Daloa. Data were generated by the administration of a household questionnaire (N=500) between February and June 2012 to assess how the population perceived transmission of BU, focus group discussions with local communities (N=8) to analyse ideologies regarding transmission patterns and semi-structured interviews with patients or their parents, former BU patients and traditional healers (N=30). The interviewees' empirical knowledge of the disease was found to be close to its biomedical description. Their aetiological perception of the disease was linked to natural (e.g. dirty water, insects) and supernatural (e.g. witchcraft, fate) causes. Some informants attributed the spread of the disease to recently immigrated neighbouring communities whose arrival coincided with an increase in reported BU cases.

From each disease site, three patients were selected and 4DCT data sets were used. We applied two planning methods using the Monaco treatment planning system (Elekta AB,Stockholm,Sweden): (1) the conventional ITV method using a 6MV Agility beam and (2) a simulated tracking method using MLC GTV tracking with a 7MV MR-linac beam model incorporating a 1.5 T transverse magnetic field. A 5mm isotropic PTV margin was added to the ITV or the GTV, and 95% of the PTV volume received 100% of the prescription dose. To evaluate the potential radiobiological advantages of tumor tracking, the normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) were calculated for each organ at risk (OAR) using the Layman Kutcher Burman (LKB) model. The average reduction in the target volume, due to tracking, was 31.1%, 26.3% and 26.9% for liver, pancreas and kidney patients, respectively. For each OAR, the % differences in NTCP between the two methods were calculated. The mean 2 Gy equivalent OAR dose for all patients was less than 29.1 Gy, below which the NTCP for most OARs was not sensitive to equivalent uniform dose (EUD). As a result, a NTCP benefit, due to tracking, was observed in 26% of the data. For all three disease sites, the maximum NTCP improvements were for the normal kidney, the bowels, and the duodenum, with reductions in associated toxicities of 79% (radiation nephropathy), 69% (stricture/fistula) and 25% (ulceration), respectively. This study demonstrates the potential benefit of using a MR-linac tracking system to reduce NTCPs. The normal kidney, the bowels and the duodenum showed the largest NTCP improvements.

Our findings indicate that psychological, economic, and physical aggression against the mother was more frequent than against the father. Daughters are more likely to use psychological aggression toward their fathers and mothers, whereas sons are more likely to use financial and physical aggression.

Core features of ASD include impaired social communication and early language delay. Thus, examining white matter tracts associated with language may lend further insight into early signs of ASD risk and the mechanisms that underlie language impairments associated with the disorder. Evidence of altered structural connectivity has previously been detected in 6-month-old infants at high familial risk for developing ASD. However, as language processing begins in utero, differences in structural connectivity between language regions may be present in the early infant brain shortly after birth. Here we investigated key white matter pathways of the dorsal language network in 6-week-old infants at high (HR) and low (LR) risk for ASD to identify atypicalities in structural connectivity that may predict altered developmental trajectories prior to overt language delays and the onset of ASD symptomatology. Compared to HR infants, LR infants showed higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF); in contrast, in the right SLF, HR infants showed higher FA than LR infants. Additionally, HR infants showed more rightward lateralization of the SLF. Across both groups, measures of FA and lateralization of these pathways at 6 weeks of age were related to later language development at 18 months of age as well as ASD symptomatology at 36 months of age. These findings indicate that early differences in the structure of language pathways may provide an early predictor of future language development and ASD risk.

We expand on our previous work on beam-dependent margins and propose a novel adaptive margin concept, where margins are moulded away from selected OARs for better OAR-high-dose sparing, whilst maintaining similar dose coverage probability to the CTV. This, however, comes at a cost of a larger irradiation volume, and thus can negatively impact other structures.

Methods and Results The Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study included children from 5 Finnish University cities, who were chosen randomly from the national population register. Participants ranged from 12 to 18years in childhood (1986) and from 37 to 43years in midadulthood (2011). Ideal CVH was defined according to the American Heart Association criteria. Retinal microvascular measures included diameters, lengths, length:diameter ratio, and tortuosity. From childhood to adulthood, fasting plasma glucose and blood pressure were significantly higher in those with impaired fasting glucose or diabetes mellitus. Childhood ideal CVH was negatively associated with adult arteriolar tortuosity (=-0.008; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.01 to -0.003; P=0.001). Improved ideal CVH from childhood to adulthood was positively associated with adult arteriolar diameter (=0.122; 95% CI, 0.01-0.24; P=0.033) and negatively associated with adult length:diameter ratio (=-0.666; 95% CI, -1.25 to -0.08; P=0.026). When stratified by glucose metabolism, among those with diabetes mellitus and impaired fasting glucose, there was a negative association between childhood ideal CVH and adult venular diameter (diabetes mellitus: =-2.75; 95% CI , -5.46 to -0.04; P=0.047; impaired fasting glucose: =-2.13; 95% CI, -4.18 to -0.08; P=0.042). Conclusions This study is the first to comprehensively examine the impact of CVH from childhood to midadulthood on quantitative measures of the retinal microvasculature.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We used data from laboratory-confirmed syphilis-infected women who delivered between 2013 and 2015 and were registered in China's Information Management System for Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of Syphilis. Sociodemographic, clinical, and prevention predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e., congenital syphilis, neonatal death, and neonatal asphyxia) were assessed using multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS Among 807 eligible pregnant women with syphilis in Beijing, the maternal syphilis ratios increased from 1.1 (in 2013) to 1.4 (in 2015) per 1000 live births, while adverse pregnancy outcomes decreased, including congenital syphilis (1.3% to 0.4%), neonatal deaths (1.3% to 0%), and neonatal asphyxia (0.9% to 0%). Both prevention and treatment interventions increased, including antenatal testing (93.5% to 93.9%), any treatment (76.6% to 85.2%), adequate treatment (51.1% to 65.1%), and treatment initiated in the first trimester (30.7% to 42.8%). In the logistic regression analysis, higher maternal rapid plasma reagin antibody titers (aOR=1.1 95%CI=1.0-1.1) and third-trimester syphilis diagnosis (aOR=1.7 95%CI=1.1-2.6) were independent risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Protective factors included being married (aOR=0.4; 95%CI=0.2-0.6) and adequate prenatal treatment (aOR=0.3; 95%CI=0.1-0.7). CONCLUSIONS Integrated strategies for maternal syphilis control were associated with improved outcomes but must be strengthened. Future efforts should include education and outreach for antenatal care for at-risk women, syphilis screening at first antenatal care visit, immediate initiation of treatment, and syphilis screening extended to women presenting with miscarriage or stillbirth.""",,,Liu,Kaibo,K,,"Department of Perinatal Health Care, Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China (mainland).",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,Med Sci Monit,9609063,1234-1010,,,,6,0,epublish,,10.12659/MSM.910216

Similarly, numerous patients with borderline cardiac function, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, especially with associated fluid overload or cumulative positive fluid balance, are at high risk of weaning failure of cardiac origin. The diagnosis of weaning-induced pulmonary oedema (WiPO) relies on the measurement of elevated left ventricular filling pressure, or on the presence of a surrogate reflecting pulmonary or cardiac congestion. Plasma concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide and N-terminal proBNP, biological signs of hemoconcentration (increased circulating protein or hemoglobin levels), or measurement of extravascular pulmonary lung water using transpulmonary thermodilution have been proved valuable surrogates for the identification of weaning failure. Nevertheless, studies have not yet compared these indirect methods to precisely determine their respective diagnostic values for the identification of WiPO, especially in heart failure patients. In addition, none of these approaches directly assess left ventricular filling pressure and the mechanism of WiPO. In contrast, critical care echocardiography is ideally suited to establish the diagnosis of weaning failure of cardiac origin. It allows identifying the high-risk population, monitoring hemodynamically the patient at risk, depicting an abrupt increase of left ventricular filling pressure consistent with WiPO when the patient fails weaning, identifying the underlying mechanism of WiPO, and finally it allows tailoring the therapeutic management of the patient who failed weaning. The impact on patient-centered outcomes of such integrated management strategy based on critical care echocardiography deserves to be prospectively tested in a large population of patients at high risk of weaning failure of cardiac origin.'",,,Vignon,Philippe,P,,"Faculty of Medicine, University of Limoges, Limoges, France.",eng,,Review,,,China,Ann Transl Med,101617978,2305-5839,,,,6,1,ppublish,,PMC6186572

This study aimed to determine the effect of hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and its changes on the risk of acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ), stroke, cerebrovascular disease and all-cause mortality among young women. Methods and Results We analyzed data from the Korean National Health Information Database on 808143 women aged 20 to 39years without any cardiocerebrovascular disease. A 1-time Hb concentration and changes in Hb over a 2-year period were calculated as exposures. Participants were followed for a median of 10years to determine the risk of AMI , stroke, cerebrovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. There were U- or J-shaped associations between Hb concentration or change in Hb and AMI , stroke, cerebrovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. Increasing the Hb concentration from normal to high increased the risk for AMI (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.49 [1.08-2.04]). With regard to the risk for stroke, increasing the Hb concentration from a normal to a high range increased the risk (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.10 [1.02-1.35]), and decreasing the Hb concentration from a high to a normal range decreased this risk (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.80 [0.60-0.97]). Improving anemia to the normal Hb range decreased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.81 [0.69-0.94]); however, overcorrection of Hb concentration (Hb14.0g/dL) was not significant.

Their article focuses on the importance of the sexual rights of individuals with neurocognitive disorders, principally dementia, in which there is a progressive decrease in executive functioning leading to impaired communication, understanding, and judgment. Individuals with dementia may be increasingly challenged to maintain autonomy in life, such as in cases of financial decision-making, self-care, end-of-life care, and, as Joy and Weiss point out, decisions pertaining to sexual relations. They highlight a possible trend of placing increasing restrictions on the freedom of aging patients to have sexual intimacy, to ensure their safety, and to prevent the potential of sexual abuse or other forms of harm. They propose the development of a ""hypothetical sexual advance directive"" for those at risk for incapacity, in collaboration with forensic psychiatrists. Although we agree that sexual rights should be legally protected by the established principles of the right to govern one\'s own body, rights of privacy, and autonomy, we are concerned that the requirement to have a signed and witnessed sexual advance directive may have unintended consequences that decrease, rather than enhance the sexual rights of people with dementia and other types of intellectual disabilities. We propose an alternative in which established and consensual sexual intimacy is treated as an aspect of the right to bodily self-determination that should not require an advance directive.'",,,Fedoroff,J Paul,JP,,"Ms. Hashmi is a Medical Student, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, and National Officer, Canadian Federation of Medical Students, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Although depression and grief share similarities, they are distinct constructs. We aimed to identify if grief was related to inflammation among those who had a spouse recently die. We also sought to determine if those who are widowed and already experience elevated levels of depressive symptoms compared with the general population had higher levels of inflammation compared with those who are widowed who report fewer depressive symptoms. Ninety-nine recently bereaved individuals (M=84.74 days since passing, SD=18.17) completed a blood draw and psychological assessments. Proinflammatory T cell-derived cytokines were assessed, which included interferon gamma (IFN-), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), IL17-A, and IL-2. Bereaved individuals with a higher grief severity (using an established cut-score) had higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-, IL-6, and TNF- than those with less grief severity. Those who experienced higher levels of depression exhibited elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines compared with those who had lower levels of depression (using a continuous measure of depressive symptoms, as well as an established cut score). This is the first study to demonstrate that inflammatory markers can distinguish those who are widowed based on grief severity such that those who are higher on grief severity have higher levels of inflammation compared with those who are lower on grief severity.

However, in cirrhotic patients with sufficiently high HCC incidence, surveillance using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with liver-specific contrast showed markedly higher sensitivity in detecting early-stage HCC than US. This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of semiannual surveillance using MRI vs. US in patients with compensated cirrhosis, and to identify the population that would gain optimal cost-effectiveness through MRI surveillance. We designed a Markov model to compare the expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), between MRI and US, with a 20-year time horizon, from the healthcare system perspective. The starting age of the cohort was 50 years, and 71% had hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis. The cycle length was 6 months. Transition probabilities and costs were obtained mainly from a prospective cohort study (the PRIUS study, NCT01446666). Cost and effectiveness were discounted at 5%. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated and tested using sensitivity analyses. The cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that the use of MRI incurred $5,562 incremental costs, 0.384 incremental life-years (LY), and 0.221 incremental QALY compared to US. The annual HCC incidence was the most influential factor on the ICER. The ICERs were $14,474/LY and $25,202/QALY at an annual HCC incidence of 3%. When the HCC incidence rate was >1.81%, the ICER was below $50,000/QALY. With increased HCC incidence, MRI surveillance was acceptable as a cost-effective option, even with increased MRI/US cost ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Semiannual surveillance using MRI with liver-specific contrast may be more cost-effective than US in patients with virus-associated compensated cirrhosis at sufficiently high HCC risk despite the higher test cost of MRI.

Extr a-axial fluid (EA-CSF), which is characterized by the CSF in the subarachnoid space, is promising in the early detection of children at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Currently, though, there is no tool to extract local EA-CSF measurements in a way that is suitable for localized analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the localized, cortical surface based analysis of EA-CSF. In our proposed processing, we combine probabilistic brain tissue segmentation, cortical surface reconstruction as well as streamline based local EA-CSF quantification. For streamline computation, we employ the vector field generated by solving a Laplacian partial differential equation (PDE) between the cortical surface and the outer CSF hull. To achieve sub-voxel accuracy while minimizing numerical errors, fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) integration was used to generate the streamlines. Finally, the local EA-CSF is computed by integrating the CSF probability along the generated streamlines. The proposed local EA-CSF extraction tool was used to study the early postnatal brain development in typically developing infants. The results show that the proposed localized EA-CSF extraction pipeline can produce statistically significant regions that are not observed in previous global approach.'",,,Styner,Martin A,MA,,"Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,101524122,0277-786X,,,,6,1,ppublish,,NIHMS963732

We assessed survival, growth, aerobic performance and critical thermal maxima (CTmax) following acute and 21 d exposures to temperatures up to 4C higher than current maxima for six species of freshwater fishes indigenous to tropical countries and of importance for human consumption. All six species showed 1.3-1.7C increases in CTmax with a 4C rise in acclimation temperature, values which match up well with fishes from other climatic regions, and five species had survival >87% at all temperatures over the treatment period. Specific growth rates varied among and within each species in response to temperature treatments. For all species, the response of resting metabolic rate (RMR) was consistently more dynamic than for maximum metabolic rate, but in general both acute temperature exposure and thermal acclimation had only modest effects on aerobic scope (AS). However, RMR increased after warm acclimation in 5 of 6 species, suggesting incomplete metabolic compensation. Taken in total, our results show that each species had some ability to perform at temperatures up to 4C above current maxima, yet also displayed certain areas of concern for their long-term welfare. We therefore suggest caution against the overly broad generalization that all tropical freshwater fish species will face severe challenges from warming temperatures in the coming decades and that future vulnerability assessments should integrate multiple performance metrics as opposed to relying on a single response metric. Given the societal significance of inland fisheries in many parts of the tropics, our results clearly demonstrate the need for more species-specific studies of adaptive capacity to climate change-related challenges.'",,,Cooke,Steven J,SJ,,"Fish Ecology and Conservation Physiology Laboratory, Department of Biology and Institute of Environmental Science, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",eng,,Journal Article,,,England,Conserv Physiol,101656116,2051-1434,,,,6,1,epublish,,PMC6188536

The article discusses the difficulties of measuring material deprivation and identifies several sources of measurement error and selection bias. However, even when controlling for such errors and biases, regression models for different deprivation indices show a significant downward trend in material deprivation for the German resident population. Given the simultaneous decrease in absolute income poverty, it is concluded that measures of material deprivation behave like absolute income poverty indicators if the list of possessions and activities is not updated to changed living standard standards in society. A similar downward trend is observed also for individuals receiving basic income support.

A number of novel urinary biomarkers have been introduced into the clinical space, which in combination with clinical variables, have demonstrated an increased ability to select patients for biopsy and identify men at risk of harboring clinically significant PCa. Though a number of assays require further validation, initial data is promising and forthcoming results will ultimately determine their clinical utility and commercial availability. For the past 30 years, first-line screening for PCa has relied on measurement of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and the results from a digital rectal exam (DRE). A large body of evidence from the last 3 decades indicates that these screening methods are problematic, and often inadequate for detecting clinically significant PCa. Extensive efforts have recently been made to identify and commercialize novel PCa biomarkers for more effective detection of PCa, either alone or in combination with current screening methods. This review article highlights problems with current screening standards, and discusses 6 urinary biomarker assays in terms of their ability to detect and risk-stratify PCa: prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), TMPRSS2-ERG, second chromosome locus associated with prostate-1 (SChLAP1), ExoDx, SelectMDx, and Michigan Prostate Score (MiPS).'",,,George,Arvin K,AK,,"Department of Urology, Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.",eng,,Review,,,China,Transl Androl Urol,101581119,2223-4683,,,,6,1,ppublish,,PMC6178315

This underscores the need to identify risk processes that lead to externalizing outcomes. This study examined the extent to which the effects of three dimensions of beliefs supporting aggression on physical aggression and externalizing behavior are mediated by anger dysregulation and callous-unemotional (CU) traits. Three waves of data were collected from a primarily African American (77%) sample of 265 middle school students between the ages of 11 and 15 (52% were female). We found evidence supporting mediation such that the effects of beliefs supporting instrumental aggression and beliefs that fighting is sometimes necessary at Wave 1 on student-reported physical aggression at Wave 3 were mediated by CU traits at Wave 2, and relations between beliefs supporting reactive aggression at Wave 1 and teacher-report of student frequencies of physical aggression and externalizing behavior at Wave 3 were mediated by anger dysregulation at Wave 2. Our findings demonstrated the importance of distinguishing between dimensions of beliefs supporting aggression, as differential paths emerged between specific beliefs, CU traits and anger dysregulation, and externalizing outcomes. These findings have important clinical implications, as they suggest that specific dimensions of beliefs supporting aggression could be targeted based on whether an individual is at risk for behavior patterns characterizing CU traits or anger dysregulation.'",,,Farrell,Albert D,AD,,"Department of Psychology, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,Aggress Behav,7502265,0096-140X,,,,6,0,aheadofprint,,10.1002/ab.21800

Risk analysis of this study population supports that age is an independent negative prognostic factor, even when accounting for stage, histology, and race. Furthermore, older women receive less-aggressive treatment as compared with their younger counterparts, with a significant number receiving no treatment at all. Despite this, older women still obtain a significant survival benefit with less-aggressive therapies, particularly with BT alone. Most interesting is that BT shows a survival benefit for older women among all cervical cancer stages, supporting the immense potential clinical benefit. In fact, women over 70 years with more advanced stage disease showed a significant survival benefit, both overall survival and disease-specific survival, with BT over external beam radiotherapy as well. Previous studies have created a foundation of literature, which shows that inclusion of BT in treatment regimens among all age groups improves survival and that older women in general are less likely to be adequately treated for cervical cancer. The novelty of this study lies in the fact that it demonstrates that older women, who we show are at risk for a poorer overall prognosis because of their age, are not only receiving appropriate treatment less often, they are also dying more frequently because of it. Our data support that older women are a high-risk group of patients who would benefit significantly from treatment, even if that treatment is BT alone.

Five of the nine mining site sediments showed significant toxicity to both species using survival (A. subtenuis and C. tepperi) and emergence (C. tepperi) as endpoints. Each LoE (SQG comparison and PCA analysis) provided a list of possible contaminants of concern for toxic sites, each list differing from one another. Evaluating these LoE collectively resulted in a stronger characterization of causality and reduced the potential contaminants of concern to a select few, including mainly: copper, sulfate, and acidic pH. Although using multiple lines of evidence reduced the number of potential contaminants of concern, the causality results were still not entirely conclusive, thus we also conducted preliminary investigations using toxicity identification evaluations (TIEs). These TIE investigations, showed the overall importance of acidic pH in these sediments, but also show the need for further work to improve the TIE technique for these types of sediment. The present study illustrates the strengths of using multiple LoE in assessing aquatic risk, especially in the assessment of complex sediments such as those in mining areas of Tasmania.

In all three models, higher levels of victimization and traumatic stressors were associated with significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms. More frequent stressors prior to T1 directly predicted depressive symptoms at T1 and indirectly predicted depressive symptoms at T2, which, in turn, predicted depressive symptoms at T3.

Exposure to more traumatic events in childhood and in adulthood independently predicted elevated hair cortisol concentrations in pregnancy. Notably, the impact of childhood exposure to traumatic events remained after accounting for more proximal traumatic events in adulthood. Further, there was a significant interaction between childhood and adult exposures. Traumatic experiences in adulthood were more strongly associated with hair cortisol concentrations among mothers with a history of greater childhood trauma. Findings suggest that not only do proximal adult exposures impact HPA-axis functioning during pregnancy, but that childhood traumatic experiences have persisting consequences for HPA-axis functioning during pregnancy. Maternal HPA-axis dysregulation in pregnancy has consequences for both maternal health and for fetal development. Therefore, we consider prenatal maternal HPA-axis functioning as a potential biological pathway underlying intergenerational consequences of childhood trauma.'",,,Davis,Elysia Poggi,EP,,"Department of Psychology, University of Denver, Denver CO, USA; Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.",eng,,Journal Article,,,Netherlands,Biol Psychol,0375566,0301-0511,,,,6,0,aheadofprint,,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2018.10.006

Nontarget aquatic wildlife, such as amphibians, may be at risk of exposure. Studies using larval stages suggest neonicotinoids are a minor concern to amphibians; however, behavioral effects manifesting later in life are not often considered. Behavioral endpoints could further our understanding of potential sublethal neurotoxic effects after exposure has ended. Using juvenile wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus), we investigated the effects of chronic larval exposure to 3 concentrations (1, 10, and 100g/L) of formulations containing imidacloprid or thiamethoxam on the putative escape response to a simulated heron attack. We found that control frogs actively responded (i.e., moved or jumped) to the simulated predator attack but frogs exposed to imidacloprid at 10 and 100g/L were less likely to respond. The exposed frogs, specifically from the imidacloprid treatment at 10g/L (tendency at 100g/L) were less likely to leave the attack area compared with controls. However, frogs used refuge similarly among all treatments. Finally, there were no differences in locomotor performance, as measured by total number of jumps and distance traveled during a trial among treatments. In conclusion, our study suggests that exposure to neonicotinoids during amphibian larval development may affect a juvenile frog's ability to perceive or respond to a predator, potentially increasing their vulnerability to predation. Future studies should validate and explore this potential effect further. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;9999:1-9.  2018 Crown in the right of Canada.

Here, we document the contribution of the UHR approach to understanding the underlying mechanisms of psychosis onset as well as the long-term outcomes. Particularly, we highlight that psychosis onset can be delayed in those meeting UHR criteria and that these criteria have a higher valence for subsequent psychotic disorders and some valence for persistent non-psychotic syndromes. Critiques have helped to identify some of the limitations of this paradigm, which are acknowledged. These include evidence that psychotic disorders can emerge more acutely and from other, as yet undefined, precursor states. Rather than defending, or alternatively questioning the value of, the UHR approach, we propose a broader, transdiagnostic staging model that is consistent with the pluripotent and variably comorbid trajectories for mental disorders. This approach moves beyond psychosis to capture a wider range of subthreshold symptoms and full-threshold disorders, thus enhancing prediction for the emergence and progression of a range of mental disorders, as well as providing new avenues for early intervention and prevention.'",,,Mei,Cristina,C,,"Centre for Youth Mental Health, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.",eng,,Review,,,England,Evid Based Ment Health,100883413,1362-0347,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.1136/ebmental-2018-300061

Mapping can be performed using activation and entrainment techniques during VT, or by substrate mapping performed in stable sinus or paced rhythm. Activation and entrainment mapping requires the patient to be in continuous VT, which may not be haemodynamically tolerated, or, if tolerated, may lead to adverse sequelae related to impaired end organ perfusion. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices may facilitate haemodynamic stability and preserve end organ perfusion during sustained VT to permit mapping for long periods. Available options for haemodynamic support include an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), TandemHeart left atrial to femoral artery bypass system, Impella left ventricle (LV) to aorta flow-assist system and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO); the bypass and assist devices provide far better augmentation of cardiac output than IABP. MCS has potential key advantages including maintenance of vital organ perfusion, reduction of intra-cardiac filling pressures, reduction of LV volumes, wall stress, and myocardial consumption of oxygen, and improvement of coronary perfusion during prolonged periods of VT induction and/or mapping. Observational studies show MCS allows for longer duration of mapping, and increased likelihood of VT termination, without an increased risk of peri-procedural mortality or VT recurrence in follow-up, despite being used in a significantly sicker cohort of patients. However, MCS has increased risk of complications related to vascular access, bleeding, thromboembolic risk, mapping system interference, increase procedural complexity and increased cost. Acute haemodynamic decompensation occurs in 11% of patients undergoing VT ablation, and is associated with increased mortality. Prospectively identifying patients at risk of acute haemodynamic decompensation in the peri-procedural period may allow prophylactic MCS. Although observational studies of MCS in patients at high risk of haemodynamic decompensation are encouraging, its benefit needs to be proven in randomised trials. This review will summarise the indication for MCS, forms of MCS, procedural outcomes, complications and utility of MCS during VT ablation.'",,,Kumar,Saurabh,S,,"Department of Cardiology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia; Department of Cardiology, Westmead Hospital, Westmead Applied Research Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

Our objective was to determine how time affects penumbral salvage and infarct growth in untreated acute ischemic stroke patients and whether collateral status affects this relationship. Methods- We used a prospectively collected, multicenter acute stroke registry to assess acute stroke patients who were not treated with intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment. We analyzed baseline computed tomography angiogram and computed tomography perfusion within 24 hours of stroke onset along with follow-up imaging and assessed time from stroke onset to baseline imaging, ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score), vessel occlusion, collaterals, ischemic core, and penumbra. Penumbral salvage and infarct growth were calculated. Correlations between time and penumbral salvage and infarct growth were evaluated with Spearman correlation. Penumbral salvage and infarct growth were compared between subjects with good versus poor collateral status using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Clinical and imaging factors affecting penumbral salvage and infarct growth were evaluated by linear regression. Results- Among 94 untreated stroke patients eligible for this analysis, the mean age was 65 years, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 13, and median (range) time from stroke onset to baseline imaging was 2.9 (0.4-23) hours. There was no correlation between time and salvaged penumbra ( r=0.06; P=0.56) or infarct growth ( r=-0.05; P=0.61).

The hypothesis that EVs may be critical in co-opting tissues by tumours to generate distant metastatic niches is particularly pertinent to prostate cancer (PCa), where metastatic-tropism to bone predominates over other tissue types. The potential role of EVs as a means of communication between PCa cells and cells of the bone stroma such as osteoblasts, is yet to be fully explored. In this study, we demonstrate that PCa cell EVs both enhance osteoblast viability and produce a significantly more supportive growth environment for PCa cells when grown in co-culture with EV-treated osteoblasts (p<0.005). Characterisation of the RNA cargo of EVs produced by the bone-metastatic PCa cell line PC3, highlights the EV-RNA cargo is significantly enriched in genes relating to cell surface signalling, cell-cell interaction, and protein translation (p<0.01). Using novel techniques to track RNA, we demonstrate the delivery of a set of PCa-RNAs to osteoblast via PCa-EVs and show the effect on osteoblast endogenous transcript abundance. Taken together, by using proof-of-concept studies we demonstrate for the first time the contribution of the RNA element of the PCa EV cargo, providing evidence to support PCa EV communication via RNA molecules as a potential novel route to mediate bone metastasis.

Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) testing dietary behaviour change interventions published between January 2006 and November 2015 were identified via searches in Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Quality of reviews were appraised using AMSTAR. Dietary behaviour change and intervention details were extracted and systematically summarised. Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Dietary behaviour changes in response to nutrition interventions were significant in over half of interventions. Reducing dietary fat and increasing fruits and vegetables were the most common behaviour changes. The characteristics of nutrition interventions and their relationship to effectiveness for dietary behaviour change among chronic disease or at-risk populations were reported inconsistently. However, associative evidence exists to support more frequent contacts and the use of specific behaviour change techniques. No clear relationships were found between effectiveness and intervention setting, mode of delivery or intervention provider, although some population-specific relationships were identified. Interventions that promote long-term maintenance of dietary behaviour changes are lacking in the literature. This comprehensive umbrella review identifies specific characteristics of interventions that are associated with effectiveness in interventions that promote dietary behaviour change among different at-risk populations.

Lesions in the brain, lung, and liver have been reported as target lesions. However, lymph node oligometastases could be a good candidate for stereotactic body radiotherapy as well. In this study, the usability of stereotactic body radiotherapy for oligometastases to lymph nodes is assessed by researching for each primary site. As a result, we could consider that stereotactic body radiotherapy could be almost well applied for lymph node oligometastases from the breast, gynecological organs, and prostate. However, doubts remain concerning the usefulness of stereotactic body radiotherapy for cervical node metastases from head and neck cancer or for mediastinal node metastases from lung or esophageal cancer since late toxicities have occurred with a large radiation dose at hypofractionation to major vessels or the central respiratory tract, especially in patients with irradiation histories. In addition, high-dose irradiation is required to control lymph node metastases from colorectal cancer due to its radioresistance, and severe late adverse events would therefore occur in adjacent organs such as the gastrointestinal tract. In cases of lymph node oligometastases with a primary tumor in the stomach or esophagus, stereotactic body radiotherapy should be used limitedly at present because this patient population is not so large and these metastases are often located close to organs at risk. Because of the varied status of recurrence and varied conditions of patients, it is difficult to determine the optimal dose for tumor control. It might be reasonable to determine the treatment dose individually based on dose constraints of adjacent organs. The oligometastatic state is becoming more frequently identified with more sensitive methods of detecting such oligometastases. In addition, there seems to be another type of oligometastases, so-called induced oligometastases, following successful systemic treatment. To determine the optimal indication of stereotactic body radiotherapy for lymph node oligometastases, further investigation about the mechanisms of oligometastases and further clinical studies including a phase III study are needed.'",,,Kadoya,Noriyuki,N,,"1 Department of Radiation Oncology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.",eng,,Journal Article,,,United States,Technol Cancer Res Treat,101140941,1533-0338,,,,6,0,ppublish,,PMC6201169

Materials and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of anterior and posterior basal forebrain seeds was investigated, as well as PET-measured global amyloid- load by using standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in 267 older cognitively intact individuals with subjective memory complaints (age range, 70-85 years; overall mean age, 75.8 years; 167 women [mean age, 75.9 years] and 100 men [mean age, 75.8 years]). The participants were from the Investigation of Alzheimer's Predictors in Subjective Memory Complainers (INSIGHT-preAD) cohort (date range, 2013-present). The relationship between SUVR and the basal forebrain RSFC was assessed, followed by the effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and sex on the basal forebrain RSFC. Results Higher SUVR values correlated with lower posterior basal forebrain RSFC in the hippocampus and the thalamus (Pearson r =-0.23; P <.001 corrected for familywise error [FWE]). Both sex and APOE genotype impacted the associations between basal forebrain RSFC and the global amyloid deposition (t values >3.59; P <.05 corrected for FWE). Conclusion Data indicate a distinct in vivo association between posterior basal forebrain dynamics and global fibrillary amyloid- pathology in cognitively intact older adults with subjective memory complaints; both apolipoprotein E and sex moderate such association.

Eighty-three healthy volunteers (50 females) underwent quantitative assessment of olfactory function (odour detection threshold, discrimination, and identification). Each participant was rated for trait impulsivity index using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and performed a battery of tasks to assess behavioural impulsivity (Stop Signal Task, SST; Information Sampling Task, IST; Delay Discounting). Lower odour discrimination predicted high ratings in non-planning impulsivity (Barratt Non-Planning impulsivity subscale); both, lower odour discrimination and detection threshold predicted low inhibitory control (SST; increased motor impulsivity). These findings extend clinical observations to support the hypothesis that deficits in olfactory ability are linked to impulsive tendencies within the healthy population.

The purpose of this review was to explore the effect of multidomain lifestyle intervention strategies on the delay and/or prevention of cognitive impairment in healthy older individuals. The methods are based on a literature review of available sources found on the research topic in three acknowledged databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. The results of the identified original studies reveal that multidomain lifestyle interventions generate significant effects.

Additionally, there exists a strong claim regarding the dimensional nature of ASD, such that even among non-diagnosed individuals, a continuous distribution of symptom severity can be observed. Executive function (EF) has been widely studied in children, adolescents, and adults with ASD, with a robust body of research supporting widespread EF deficits in diagnosed individuals. However, it remains unclear how the degree of ASD symptomatology, outside of the presence of a diagnosis, affects EF abilities in a community sample. The First Year Inventory 2.0 (FYI 2.0), a parent-report measure, was designed to identify infants at 12 months who are at risk for an eventual ASD diagnosis. In the current study, a continuous scoring scale was used to examine risk (overall, Social-Communication, and Sensory-Regulatory) from a dimensional perspective. Parents also completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version and the Social Responsiveness Scale-2nd edition when their children were 42 months (3.5 years) old. Each FYI 2.0 risk variable significantly predicted scores on an overall EF composite and specific EF subscales. When controlling for general ASD symptomatology, Sensory-Regulatory risk still significantly predicted EF deficits. This research provides additional support for a quantitative consideration of risk for ASD and presents novel findings regarding the relation between infant behaviors indicative of ASD risk and EF in early childhood.

Studying children without ASD who may have symptoms affecting EF is also important. This study demonstrates that certain infant behaviors related to ASD are linked to early childhood EF difficulties.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy may be beneficial, however this requires cell acquisition, culture and delivery. Endogenous mobilization of stem cells offers a non-invasive alternative. The hypothesis was administration of VEGF and the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 would increase the circulating pool of available MSCs and improve fracture healing. Ex-breeder female wistar rats received VEGF followed by AMD3100, or sham PBS. Blood prepared for culture and colonies were counted. P3 cells were analysed by flow cytometry, bi-differentiation. The effect of mobilization on fracture healing was evaluated with 1.5mm femoral osteotomy stabilized with an external fixator in 12-14 week old female Wistars. The mobilized group had significantly greater number of cfus/ml compared to controls, P=0.029. The isolated cells expressed 1.8% CD34, 35% CD45, 61% CD29, 78% CD90, and differentiated into osteoblasts but not into adipocytes. The fracture gap in animals treated with VEGF and AMD3100 showed increased bone volume; 5.221.7um^3 and trabecular thickness 0.050.01um compared with control animals (4.33.1um^3, 0.040.01um respectively). Radiographic scores quantifying fracture healing (RUST) showed that the animals in the mobilization group had a higher healing score compared to controls (9.6 vs 7.7). Histologically, mobilization resulted in significantly lower group variability in bone formation (p=0.032) and greater amounts of bone and less fibrous tissue than the control group. Clinical significance: This pre-clinical study demonstrates a beneficial effect of endogenous MSC mobilization on fracture healing, which may have translation potential to prevent or treat clinical fractures at risk of delayed or non-union fractures.

We consider how a pure psychology approach that ignores neuroscience is at risk of being misleading for educators. We address the major criticisms of the field comprising, respectively, a priori arguments against the relevance of neuroscience to education, reservations with the current practical operation of the field, and doubts about the viability of neuroscience methods for diagnosing disorders or predicting individual differences.

A phase IIb study has been initiated with the experimental broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) VRC01, which has considerable breadth and potency (also referred to as a phase IIb HVTN 703/HPTN 081 and HVTN 704/HPTN 085 AMP efficacy trials) to evaluate its protective efficacy in individuals at risk of HIV acquisition. bnAbs prevent HIV-1 infection by selectively targeting vulnerable sites on the viral envelope (Env) protein that facilitates the entry of HIV. Although in very early stages, bnAbs capable of neutralizing a broad range of inter- and intraclade HIV-1 isolates have been demonstrated to have potential in treating patients either alone or in combination with antiretroviral drug therapy (cART); however, they are proposed to be advantageous over the latter as far as durability and side effects are concerned. Recent studies have indicated that combination therapy of potent bnAbs along with latency-reversing agents (LRAs) might also target latent reservoirs of HIV and kill them by recruiting effector cells, such as natural killer cells, thus confirming clinical progression.

Pruritus and fatigue are the most common symptoms. Liver transplantation for pruritus is highly effective but fatigue will not disappear in the majority of the patients. In contrast to other liver diseases, portal hypertension may develop in pre-cirrhotic patients with PBC. Patients with PBC have an incidence rate of 3.4 hepatocellular carcinoma cases for every 1000 patient-years and risk factors are advanced stage of the disease and male sex. For the appropriate timing of LT the utility of prognostic models (bilirubin, Mayo risk score and MELD, in particular) and standard exception points in case of HCC are established. However, recent data from different part of the world demonstrated that PBC patients compared to patients with PSC have higher waiting-list mortality. Hyperlipidemia can be present in up to 80% of the patients but there is no evidence for an elevated cardiovascular risk, certainly not in relationship with LT. Patients transplanted for PBC suffer more frequently from acute cellular and also late cellular rejection. However, 5-year patient survival rates after LT of 80-85% is better than for most other indications. Recurrent PBC is reported in a range from 14% up to 42% after LT but in contrast to other autoimmune diseases graft loss due to recurrent disease is not a major issue. The type of immunosuppression after LT was found to be associated with the incidence of recurrence but since mediate-term impact on overall and graft survival is negligible, tacrolimus-based regimens remain standard at most centers. Observational studies suggest that long-term administration of UDCA following LT has a beneficial effect on recurrence of PBC.

The purpose of this work is to evaluate the feasibility of a skin dose reduction in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma without compromising the overall plan quality. This research focused on comparison of the skin dose reduction that can be obtained for the main high conformal radiotherapy delivery techniques. Sixteen cases of early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma were included in this study. For each case, a dynamic intensity-modulated radiation therapy, a volumetric modulated arc therapy, and a helical tomotherapy treatment plans were performed with and without the skin as a sensitive structure in the inverse plan optimization. The dosimetric results obtained for the different treatment techniques and plan optimizations were compared. Dose-volume histogram cutoff points of D95%, D98%, and the homogeneity index were used for target comparison, while Dmean and Dmax/D1cc were used for the organs at risk. The skin volume receiving 5 Gy and then 10 to 70 Gy of radiation dosage registered at step of 10 Gy and Dmean were used for the skin dose comparison. One-way analysis of variance was used to assess the dosimetric results obtained for the different types of treatment plans and techniques investigated. A total of 96 treatment plans were analyzed.

Our purpose is to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of risk factors for BKPyV viremia and nephropathy described in multivariate analyses. The PubMed database was searched for prospective or prospectively-based observational studies on risk factors for BKPyV viremia and/or nephropathy. Our qualitative assessment of risk factors was based on the odds ratios and hazard ratios calculated in multivariate regression analyses. Of the 241 publications screened, 34 were included in the qualitative analysis. In all, 144 and 19 distinct factors were analyzed for BKPyV viremia and for BKPyV nephropathy, respectively. Our evaluation highlighted eight risk factors for BKPyV viremia: a tacrolimus regimen, a deceased donor, a male recipient, a history of previous transplant, age at transplantation, ureteral stent use, delayed graft function, and acute rejection episodes increased the risk of BKV viremia to varying extents. Tacrolimus and acute rejection episodes were also associated with a higher incidence of BKPyV nephropathy. BKPyV reactivation is a serious complication after renal transplantation.

Nonetheless, previous literature presents some inconsistencies that might at least partially be due to the presence of risk conditions and the use of different statistical approaches to measure HPA axis co-regulation. Very preterm (VPT) birth represents one of these risk conditions as the early foundation of mother-infant interaction is disrupted. Both VPT infants and their mothers present evidence of altered HPA axis regulation. Nonetheless, the comparison of mother-infant HPA axis co-regulation in VPT infants compared to full-term (FT) ones has not been previously investigated. In this study, 3-month-old (corrected age) VPT infants and FT counterparts with their mothers took part in a well-validated stress-inducing laboratory task (i.e., double Face-to-Face Still-Face, FFSF paradigm). Salivary cortisol samples were obtained before (Baseline) and after (Early reactivity, Late reactivity and Recovery) the FFSF procedure. Dyadic HPA axis co-regulation was assessed at each sample time-point (i.e., in-moment coupling) as well as across samples (i.e., in-time synchrony). Significant in-moment coupling emerged at Baseline, Late reactivity and Recovery for FT infants' dyads only. An overlying pattern of salivary cortisol trajectories emerged between mothers and infants in the VPT group, whereas a more complex pattern of reciprocal and complementary co-regulation was found for FT infants' dyads. Although both groups gave evidence of HPA axis co-regulation, dyads of VPT infants appear to be less able to adapt reciprocally and dynamically to stressful conditions. These findings suggest that multiple approaches to account for dyadic HPA axis co-regulation should be used in order to depict the complex pattern of biological rhythms coordination in mother-infant dyads.""",,,Montirosso,Rosario,R,,"Scientific Institute, IRCCS E.

Crucially, IOP is not fixed, but varies considerably during the 24-h cycle and between one visit and another. Consequently, a single IOP measurement during so-called office hours is insufficient to characterize the real IOP pathology of a patient with glaucoma. To date IOP remains the principal and only modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of glaucoma. Only by evaluating IOP characteristics (mean, peak and fluctuation of IOP) at diagnosis and after IOP-lowering interventions can we appreciate the true efficacy of therapy. Unfortunately, a major limiting factor in glaucoma management is lack of robust IOP data collection. Treatment decisions, advancement of therapy and even surgery are often reached on the basis of limited IOP evidence. Clearly, there is much room to enhance our decision-making and to develop new algorithms for everyday practice. The precise way in which daytime IOP readings can be used as predictors of night-time or 24-h IOP characteristics remains to be determined. In practice it is important to identify those at-risk glaucoma patients for whom a complete 24-h curve is necessary and to distinguish them from those for whom a daytime curve consisting of three IOP measurements (at 10:00, 14:00 and 18:00) would suffice. By employing a staged approach in determining the amount of IOP evidence needed and the rigour required for our monitoring approach for the individual patient, our decisions will be based on more comprehensive data, while at the same time this will optimize use of resources. The patient's clinical picture should be the main factor that determines which method of IOP monitoring is most appropriate. A diurnal or ideally a 24-h IOP curve will positively impact the management of glaucoma patients who show functional/anatomical progression, despite an apparently acceptable IOP in the clinic.

Patients with other forms of immunosuppression are also at risk, and disease is increasingly recognized in apparently immunocompetent individuals. Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, responsible for the majority of cases, is distributed globally. We used the consensus ISHAM Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme to define the population structure of clinical C. neoformans var. grubii isolates from Laos (n = 81), which we placed into the global context using published MLST data from other countries (total N = 1047), including a reanalysis of 136 Vietnamese isolates previously reported. We observed a phylogeographical relationship in which the Laotian population was similar to its neighbor Thailand, being dominated (83%) by Sequence Types (ST) 4 and 6. This phylogeographical structure changed moving eastwards, with Vietnam's population consisting of an admixture of isolates dominated by the ST4/ST6 (35%) and ST5 (48%) lineages. The ST5 lineage is the predominant ST reported from China and East Asia, where it accounts for >90% of isolates. Analysis of genetic distance (Fst) between different populations of C. neoformans var. grubii supports this intermediate structure of the Vietnamese population. The pathogen and host diversity reported from Vietnam provide the strongest epidemiological evidence of the association between ST5 and HIV-uninfected patients. Regional anthropological genetic distances suggest diversity in the C. neoformans var. grubii population across Southeast Asia is driven by ecological rather than human host factors.

Traditional secondary analysis employs either completely parametric models or conditional mean regression models to link the secondary outcome to covariates. In many situations, quantile regression models complement mean-based analyses and provide alternative new insights on the associations of interest. For example, biomedical outcomes are often highly asymmetric, and median regression is more useful in describing the 'central' behaviour than mean regressions. There are also cases where the research interest is to study the high or low quantiles of a population, as they are more likely to be at risk. We approach the secondary quantile regression problem from a semiparametric perspective, allowing the covariate distribution to be completely unspecified.

This study evaluates the early OCDS predictive value in drop-out, abstinence and relapse of patients suffering from Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) for discovering an OCDS total score cut-off capable of disclosing patients most at-risk of relapse during the beginning of the therapeutic intervention in the Day-Hospital period. The sample includes 263 AUD patients, with 192 men and 71 women. The OCDS scores were measured during the two-weeksDay Hospital treatment for detoxification and after 30, 60, 90 and 180days after discharge. We also investigated the association between the all OCDS scores and abstinence and between craving, relapse and drop-out. We found that high values of OCDS during Day Hospital detoxification may predict a lower ability to maintain abstinence with elevated relapsing probabilities. Surprisingly, early dropping-out AUD people had lower OCDS total scores. However, significant differences in OCDS values in dropping-out AUD people were revealed mainly 90 and 180days after discharge compared to no dropping-out AUD subjects. Craving measured also after 30, 60, 90 and 180days from discharge in AUD relapsers, with OCDS values comprised between 6 and 10, could indicate a lower ability to continue abstinence.

Using input indicators from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the national representative survey Second Australian Study of Health and Relationships, and national HIV- behavioural surveillance, we calculated the size of the population of sexually active gay men and estimated a range for the number eligible for PrEP using different scenarios based on the guidelines. In 2015, an estimated 108,850 sexually-active 16-69-year-old gay men were classified as at risk of acquiring HIV in Australia. Of these men, 10,558 to 30,913 (9.7%-28.4%) were classified as being at high risk and therefore eligible for PrEP, most commonly due to recent receptive condomless intercourse with casual partners (6.1% to 15.5%), STI infections (5.4% to 10.6%) or the use of crystal methamphetamine (1.4% to 9.4%). The higher estimates included men who may have been at HIV risk for shorter time periods or with fewer partners. Australian PrEP guidelines recommend targeting PrEP to people at high HIV risk. Our estimation of potential PrEP users informed PrEP implementation in Australia.

Half of the human population worldwide is considered to live at risk of exposure, mostly in the poorest rural areas of the world. Prompt diagnosis of brucellosis is essential to prevent complications and to control epidemiology outbreaks, but identification of Brucella isolates may be hampered by the lack of rapid and cost-effective methods. Nowadays, many clinical microbiology laboratories use Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time Of Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for routine identification. However, lack of reference spectra in the currently commercialized databases does not allow the identification of Brucella isolates. In this work, we constructed a Brucella MALDI-TOF MS reference database using VITEK MS. We generated 590 spectra from 84 different strains (including rare or atypical isolates) to cover this bacterial genus. We then applied a novel biomathematical approach to discriminate different species. This allowed accurate identification of Brucella isolates at the genus level with no misidentifications, in particular as the closely related and less pathogenic Ochrobactrum genus. The main zoonotic species (B. melitensis, B. abortus and B. suis) could also be identified at the species level with an accuracy of 100%, 92.9% and 100%, respectively.

Pre-teen and teenage patients, who are still at risk of occurrence of new carious lesions, need more individualized caries management strategies. Therefore, this study aimed to identify caries-related risk factors and develop a simplified risk prediction model for dental caries. Risk factors for caries were assessed in 171 participants aged 10-18 years, based on a questionnaire survey, previous history of caries, oral hygiene, microorganism colonization, saliva secretion, saliva buffer capacity examinations, and the acidogenicity of dental biofilms. These risk factors were entered into a computer-based risk assessment program (the Cariogram), and correlations between these factors and Cariogram scores were investigated. Significant risk predictors were used to develop a simplified risk prediction model. The performance of this model in predicting dental caries incidence was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis, to determine its applicability to the management of caries. Our simplified prediction model included three predictors that were significantly associated with caries incidence: use of fluoride-containing toothpaste, the acidogenicity of dental biofilms, and saliva secretion (p < 0.001). The resulting model had a sensitivity and specificity of 60.5 and 85.0%, respectively, with a cut-off value of 69.41 as the threshold. The area under the curve of this model was 0.782 (95% confidence interval = 0.681-0.884, p < 0.001). Our new caries risk prediction model is expected to allow clinicians to accurately and easily predict patients' risk of occurrence of new caries.""",,,Kim,Hee-Eun,HE,,"Department of Dental Hygiene, Gachon University College of Health Science.",eng,,Journal Article,,,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,0417355,0040-8727,,,,6,0,ppublish,,10.1620/tjem.246.81

This paper studies the prevalence of the polymorphisms in p53, VEGF, IL-10, IL-11 and APOE in RIF and RPL patients that determines the risk for these pathologies. A total of 255 patients were selected (89 RPL patients, 77 RIF patients and 89 controls) and genotyped for p53-R72P; IL-11-1082-AG; VEGF-1154-AG; IL-10; APOE-R112C; APOE-R158C. Statistically significant differences were found in the prevalence of the E4 isoform (R122-R158) of the APOE gene in RPL patients (p<0.05), and in RIF patients, the R72P polymorphism of the p53 gene and the 1154-AG of the VEGF gene showed different distribution (p<0.05). Regarding the p53 and IL-11 studied polymorphisms, PP of p53 gene and GG of IL-11 are more prevalent in RPL patients without reaching statistical significance.

Multiple factors contribute to the susceptibility of infants to this illness. The immune immaturity of infants is the biggest contributor, especially pre-term infants. Because infants do not receive their first set of immunizations until 2 months of age, the risk is high for bacteremia, possibly resulting in bacterial meningitis. Those populations at highest risk are preterm infants, males, the indigent population, and infants in daycare.

Aneuploidy is not only a major issue in advanced-maternal-age patients and balanced translocation carriers, but also the aneuploidy rate is extremely high in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF), even in young donors. To adequate NGS technology to the DF-PGT strategy four different whole genome amplification systems (Sureplex, MALBAC, and two multiple displacement amplification systems-MDA) were tested using TruSight One panel on cell lines and blastocyst trophectoderm biopsies-TE. Embryo cytogenetic status was analyzed by Nexus software. Sureplex and MALBAC DNA products were considered not suitable for PGT diagnosis due to inconsistent and poor results on Trusight one (TSO) panel. Results obtained with both MDA based methods (GEH-MDA and RG-MDA) were appropriate for direct mutation detection by TSO NGS platform. Nevertheless, RG-MDA amplification products showed better coverage and lower ADO rates than GEH-MDA. The present work also demonstrates that the same TSO sequencing data is suitable not only for the direct mutation detection, but also for the indirect mutation detection by linkage analysis of informative SNPs. The present work also demonstrates that Nexus software is competent for the detection of CNV by using with TSO sequencing data from RG-MDA products, allowing for the whole cytogenetic characterization of the embryos. In conclusion, successfully development of an innovative and promising DF-PGT strategy using TSO-NGS technology in TE biopsies, performed in-house in a single laboratory experience, has been done in the present work.
